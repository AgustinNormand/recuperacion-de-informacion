the present study is a history of the dewey decimal
classification the first edition of the ddc was published
in 1876 the eighteenth edition in 1971 and future editions
will continue to appear as needed in spite of the ddcs
long and healthy life however its full story has never
been told there have been biographies of dewey
that briefly describe his system but this is the first
attempt to provide a detailed history of the work that
more than any other has spurred the growth of
librarianship in this country and abroad

this report is an analysis of 6300 acts of use
in 104 technical libraries in the united kingdom
library use is only one aspect of the wider pattern of
information use information transfer in libraries is
restricted to the use of documents it takes no
account of documents used outside the library still
less of information transferred orally from person
to person the library acts as a channel in only a
proportion of the situations in which information is
transferred
taking technical information transfer as a whole
there is no doubt that this proportion is not the
major one there are users of technical information 
particularly in technology rather than science 
who visit libraries rarely if at all relying on desk
collections of handbooks current periodicals and personal
contact with their colleagues and with people in other
organizations even regular library users also receive
information in other ways

the relationships between the organization and control of writings
and the organization and control of knowledge and information will
inevitably enter our story for writings contain along with much else a
great deal of mankinds stock of knowledge and information bibliographical
control is a form of power and if knowledge itself is a form of power
as the familiar slogan claims bibliographical control is in a certain sense
power over power power to obtain the knowledge recorded in written
form as writings are not simply and not in any simple way storehouses of
knowledge we cannot satisfactorily discuss bibliographical control as
simply control over the knowledge and information contained in writings

the establishment of nine new universities in the 1960s provoked a highly
stimulating reexamination of the nature purpose and management of academic
libraries longestablished attitudes and methods were questioned but
although changes were made the basic difficulty remained  a lack of objective
information about the best ways of providing a library service in a university
the report of the ugc committee on libraries the parry repot 267 which
in general endorsed these changes also stressed the need for research into
all aspects of academic library provision

although the use of games in professional education has
become widespread only during the last decade the method has
been used in a number of fields for many hundreds of years
its origins have been traced to simple war games used in
military training when the real thing was either unavailable
or too dangerous in more recent times these games have
become more and more sophisticated and many now use large
electronic computers to handle the complex calculations involved
since 1956 when the first welldeveloped management game was
introduced the technique has spread rapidly into a wide variety
of disciplines and today it is used at all levels of education
from primary school classes to courses for experienced professional
men and women one of the main causes of this game explosion
has been the rapid development of sophisticated management
techniques such as simulation and mathematical modelling which
have been made possible by rapid advances in computer technology

graduate library school study of abstracting should be more than a
howtodoit course
it should include general material on the characteristcs and types of abstracts
the historical development of abstracting publications the abstractpublishing
industry especially in the united states and the need for standards in the
preparation and evaluation of the product
these topics we call concepts
the text includes a methods section containing instructions for writing
various types of abstracts and for editing and preparing abstracting publications
these detailed instructions are supplemented by examples and exercises in the
appendix
there is a brief discussion of indexing of abstract publications
research on automation has been treated extensively in this work for we
believe that the topic deserves greater emphasis than it has received in the
past
computer use is becoming increasingly important in all aspects of librarianship
much research effort has been expended on the preparation and evaluation of
computerprepared abstracts and extracts
students librarians and abstractors will benefit from knowing about this
research and understanding how computer programs were researched to analyze text
select key sentences and prepare extracts and abstracts
the benefits of this research are discussed
abstracting is a key segment of the information industry
opportunities are available for both fulltime professionals and parttime or
volunteer workers
many librarians find such activities pleasant and rewarding for they know
they are contributing to the more effective use of stored information
one chapter is devoted to career opportunities for abstractors

as important for staff members individual development
as was the apprenticeship in administration perhaps the most
significant attitude one acquired while working for
guy was engendered by his insistence that librarians must
be interested in and knowledgeable about the content of the
materials with which they dealt his love of literature his
respect for scholarship his admiration for good writing and
reading were manifested in many ways but most notably in
his admonition that though we were primarily a research
library we must constantly keep in mind our obligation to
collect contemporary poetry fiction and bellesletters it
was primarily up to the library staff he felt to be
responsible for these as well as for general books which crossed
disciplinary lines or fell between the disciplines those books
which a faculty mostly concerned with research materials is
apt to overlook and in building this portion of the collection
there is no substitute for a thorough acquaintance with
books through a reading of critical reviews and the books
themselves this counsel is from the president the professor
and the college library but the importance of its thrustthe
need to keep up with the world of books and publishingwas

this study assumed that an additional use study held
less promise than an analytical consideration of concepts
the basic approach was a survey comparing traditional and
current professional ideas on direct access principal datagathering
instruments were documentary analysis and opinion questionnaire
findings of the documentary analysis included the following
research from 1890 to 1970 on the direct shelf approach
and browsing left the problems largely unresolved and
evidently resistant to established methods of use and user
research the need for an exhaustive study of concepts was
confirmed
open shelf librariesorganized through shelf classification
and relative locationwere meant to arouse the intellectual
social and political interest of the average citizen and affect
his democratic selfrealization
definitions of browsing varied greatly selfindulgence
by the untutored in objectionable works beneficial selfeducation
for the general reader valuable guidance for the scholar in his

the purpose of this study was to develop evaluate
and recommend a national plan for improving access to periodical
resources about 48 percent of all academic interlibrary loans
are for periodical materials with the bulk of the loans being
satisfied in the form of photocopies a major consideration in
the longrange improvement of the interlibrary loan system is
the possible augmentation with a national system for acquiring
storing and satisfying loan requests for periodical materials
this study focused on the physical access to the
periodical literature based on the needs of the library community
design features were developed and included the following
service should be made available to all users
without any restriction other than access
through a library
initially the service should be confined primarily
to rapid dependable delivery of photocopies of
journal articles
the collection of a center should be comprehensive
in subject coverage excluding only medicine
all worthwhile journals should be collected
irrespective of language

the scope of acquisitions work outlined in the introduction
acknowledges the importance of selection policy
serials recording and other topics kindred to acquisitions
these topics are discussed in this book only as they relate
to obtaining library materials they are examined thoroughly
in books and papers that are cited in the references and the
bibliographic note
centralized acquisitions and automation of order routines are of
major importance in order work and they are reviewed as chapters in
this book these chapters are introductions to the concepts and
problems of centralization and automation not manuals of practice
for treatment of these topics in particular and in depth the reader is
referred to the references cited for automation these references
are only a modest selection from an enormous literature

the ligue des bibliotheques europeennes de recherche liber was set up
in 1971 as an international nongovernmental organization with the aim of
establishing close collaboration between the general research libraries of
western europe particularly national and university libraries and in
particular to help in finding practical ways of improving the quality of
the services these libraries provide
at the second meeting of its general assembly held in luxembourg in 1972
liber decided to hold a seminar on the acquisition of materials from the
third world and i was charged with the intellectual organization of this
seminar the purpose of the meeting would be to examine the problems of
acquisition the availability of materials in european libraries both for
reference and for lending and the feasibility of setting up a european centre
for the collection of such material to be available for loan the provision
of bibliographic information preferable in machinereadable form was to be
a basic consideration whatever means were proposed for acquiring publications
from those areas the council of europe made a generous grant towards the
cost of the seminar which was held at the university of sussex from 17 to 19

if this book has a central thesis it rests upon the simple but
frequently neglected principle that college library service goes
beyond the commonly accepted functions of book circulation and
storage the college library exists not merely to house and
circulate library materials but to supplement and extend the teaching
process with reference service to afford faculty members library
opportunities for improving instruction and to encourage students
to read more and better books administration is essentially a
service activity a tool through which library functions are more
fully and efficiently realized
the present work retains most of the material of the first edition
but includes substantial revision in each chapter the book was
planned not only as a text in the teaching of college library
administration but also for independent professional reading because
readers have found the footnotes and chapter bibliographies useful
for reference purposes they have been brought up to date and in
some cases extended

there has long been a need for a continuing series to provide
scholarly reviews of the rapidly changing and advancing field of
librarianship a series which would select subjects with particular
current significance to the profession and provide an analysis of
the advances made through research and practice advances in
librarianship is planned and designed to fill this need it will
present critical articles and surveys based on the published literature
research in progress and developments in libraries of all types
mechanization may appear to be the most obvious of the advancing fronts
of librarianship for automation has caught the enthusiastic support of all
librarians who can visualize its potential
advances in this field will certainly be found in every volume of this series
as the first group of articles in this volume demonstrate technological change
has an obvious and direct implication for libraries but the problem has been
found to be much more complex than the simple inventory problem many experts
expected
advances in librarianship is dedicated to presenting the realities of
automation assessing where we are where we are going and how fast we can hope
to get there
the machine and cataloging reviews the current status of the machineproduced
book catalog and what lies ahead as we enter the age of marc
where business methods have greater applicability progress is easier as
reported in mechanization of acquisition processes
even in this area generally acceptable practices and standardization are in the
future not the past
one of the problems of major and immediate importance in computerization of
catalog information is that discussed in filing systems for computer
manipulation
this detailed review presents the complexity of the problems and suggests
possible solutions
for many years technical service costs have been defended without adequate
knowledge of the facts
as automated procedures are proposed standards are determining costs of
traditional operations become essential
the article on standards for such costs shows why the problems have been difficult
and reviews the significant advances of the past few years
the school library has widened its dimensions in materials and services much
more rapidly than other libraries as reflected in its new name the
instructional media center
here technical change together with new teaching methods has made possible
major developments in library service in schools as well as for children in
the public library
two articles make clear that what can be done has been demonstrated and that
what remains is to make this the rule rather than the exception
bibliotherapy is an example of a field in which progress has been slow
articles which illustrate the potential which systems theory and managerial
planning theory have for libraries
the articles on the application of these concepts which come from research in
administration are provocative and may appear controversial to some
the article on library development in developing countries provides an
analysis in depth of our efforts and degree of success in assisting other
countries in providing the library service which is so important in the modern
world

the present contribution does not duplicate previous studies but
complements the earlier publications and closes the few gaps that
exist in the literature prior to 1966 and after 1971 additionally
it is a bold attempt to evaluate critically and objectively the history
of the mechanized selective dissemination of information sdi as
reflected in the literature from the initial description by luhn
1958 1961b c to the post1970 period when the sdi boom began losing
ground to the more popular online interactive systems the review
therefore questions and interprets the concept of sdi its implementation
and its evolution in the light of work performed by many companies
government agencies universities societies and libraries during the

in trying to give an account of the statistical properties of

common thread which would show the many and multifarious forms
of language statistics  embodied in scattered papers written
by linguists philosophers mathematicians engineers each using
his own professional idiom as belonging to one great whole
quantitative linguistics
the book stresses the peculiarity of statistics of language
structure as against just conventional statistics to put the
difference between two types of statistics briefly the latter comprises
the methods and parameters of general number statistics as applied eg in
economics and demography the former has its own methods and characterising
parameters particularly useful for describing and evaluating language
structure the idea of statistical linguistics as using concepts and
methods of its own which was adumbrated in the authors language as
choice and chance 1956 has now taken definite shape
of this development i shall try to give a brief account in my book
language as choice and chance the foundation was laid for a truly
sensible application of statistics to language by my interpretation
of the langueparole dichotomy as being essentially that between statistical

most librarians mark the beginning of modern librarianship
from the founding of the american library association in 1876 and
the appearance on the national library scene of such dynamic and
controversial figures as melvil dewey and charles ammi cutter
but in doing so they overlook an extremely significant era in
the history of our profession for the quarter century preceding the
1876 meeting in philadelphia was one characterized by great advances
in the field of american librarianship this period of growth was to
have considerable influence on the course of library development in
america after 1876 to ignore the third quarter of the nineteenth
century is to risk misinterpreting the pivotal post1876 era
and in this time of reappraisal it seems particularly appropriate
and useful to focus our attention on the years preceding the founding
of the american library association

in this book lorenz deals with the evolution of aggression
in vertebrates he points out that aggressivity is totally different
from predation that it is a biological necessity for defence of
territory and for a cornered animal and that it becomes mixed
up with other innate drives thus leading up towards reduction
of intraspecific damage this be it noted is most evident in
fiercer social predators like wolves where escape from the pack
is virtually impossible and where cooperation without fighting
is necessary for survival whereas in the nonsocial but proverbially
peaceful dove prevention of escape leads to violent and often
fatal attacks on the weaker mate
in a final chapter he advances some suggestion as to how in
the human species where evolution is primarily cultural and
not guided by darwinian selection in the strict sense the
aggressive drive may be canalized into less dangerous channels
man has innumerable ways of adaptively ritualizing his behavior
many of them analogous if not homologous to those found in
animals in any event on aggression is a fascinating book by
a master of his subject

this paper is not an official policy statement
of the american library association nor
of the office for library education it is
simply an exploration an outline of possibilities
for consideration by the profession its purpose is
to generate discussion that will lead
eventually to a statement of association policy
that the profession will support and make
effective
a basic assumption on which the statement
rests is this that the library occupation is
much broader than that segment of it which is
the library profession but that the professional
segment has responsibility for the definition
and supervision of the training and education
required by the complete range of activities
encompassed by the occupation librarians
are not the only persons who work in
libraries but librarians are the ones who are
concerned with the advancement and improvement
of the library profession it follows then
that it is the obligation of the professionals
to engage actively in the establishment and
maintenance of standards and norms governing
the preparation of people who work at
any level in libraries they should define and
guide the kinds of preparation most useful at
the preprofessional level and not
merely the education of those who will hold
positions at the level we now call professional

as far back as the 1920s algebra had been accepted as the science
studying the properties of sets on which there is defined a particular
system of operations however up until the forties the overwhelming
majority of algebraists were investigating merely a few kinds of algebraic
structures these were primarily groups rings and lattices the first
general theoretical work dealing with arbitrary sets with arbitrary
operations is due to g birkhoff 1935 during these same years a
tarski published an important paper in which he formulated the basic
principles of a theory of sets equipped with a system of relations such
sets are now called models in contrast to algebra model theory made
abundant use of the apparatus of mathematical logic the possibility of
making fruitful use of logic not only to study universal algebras but
also the more classical parts of algebra such as group theory was
discovered by the author in 1936
during the next twentyfive years it gradually became clear that the
theory of universal algebras and model theory are very intimately
related despite a certain difference in the nature of their problems and
it is therefore meaningful to speak of a single theory of algebraic systems
dealing with sets on which there is defined a series of operations and
relations algebraic systems the formal apparatus of the theory is the
language of the socalled applied predicate calculus thus the theory can
be considered to border on logic and algebra

a computer program has been written and used which
simulates the severalyear operation of an information
system and computes estimates of the expected
operating costs as well as the amount of equipment
and personnel required during that time period the
program has been used for the analysis of several
large systems and has proven itself to be a useful
research tool for the study of systems with so many
components and interrelated operations that an
equivalent manual analysis would be extremely
cumbersome and time consumingand perhaps even
impractical this paper describes this program and
shows as an example some of the results of a simulation

recently a number of articles books and reports
dealing with information systems ie document retrieval
systems have advanced the doctrine that such systems
are to be evaluated in terms of the degree or percentage
of relevancy they provide
although there seems to be little agreement on what
relevance means and some doubt that it is quantifiable
there is nevertheless a growing agreement that a fixed
and formal relationship exists between the relevance and
the recall performance of any system thus we will find
in the literature both a frankly subjective notion of
relevance as reported by individual users and equations
curves and mathematical formulations which presumably provide
numerical measures of the recall and relevance
characteristics of information systems this phenomenon
of shifting back and forth from an admittedly subjective
and nonmathematical term to equations in which the
same term is given a mathematical value or a mathematical
definition has its ancient parallel in discussions
of probability one cannot of course legislate the
meaning of a term it all depends as alice pointed out
on who is master the user or the term on the other hand
the use of a single term in the same document to cover
two or more distinct meanings especially when such a
usage is designed to secure the acceptance of a doctrine
by attributing to it mathematical validity which it does
not have represents a more serious situation than merely
careless ambiguity

institute of technology being made by
members of the institutes operations research
project in cooperation with the librarians and
library staff in this report which is based
on actual observations of onthepremise use
made of the science library various statistics
measuring the kind degree and intensity of use
are tabulated in addition there are some
suggested measures of effectiveness of the library
a unique outcome of the survey has been the
construction and verification of a mathematical
model employing probability theory to measure
rate and kind of use of library material
together with length of stay of library patrons
such models characteristic of an operations

respect to the ways in which they use their professional and technical
literature the creative chemists differ from the noncreative in that the
former read more technical literature on the job are less reluctant to use
literature of greater reading difficulty are less influenced in their
independence of thought read more extensively and consult more frequently the
older material are more inquisitive and have broader cultural interests the

analysis of the problems of defining the mutual relevancies of queries and
documentcollections indicates that they essentially involve the problem of
conceptual relatedness in order to consider the later problem the question
of conceptformation is first discussed which in turn requires a definition of
concept an extensional interpretation is suggested whereby a concept is
associated with a class of conceptuallysimilar documents users similarity
judgments then provide the empirical data for formal definitions of concept and
conceptual relatedness it is found however that certain very general
difficulties rule out the possibility of defining concepts and their
relatedness by the method proposed since this method is based on human
relevancejudgments it seems a natural one to adopt so that its collapse has
serious practical and theoretical consequences an alternative approach is
therefore proposed whose elaboration will form part ii of this article

a comparison of the ability of humans to consistently judge the relevance
of documents to their general interests from bases of citations abstracts
keywords and total text was made under controlled experimental conditions
the results showed that 1 humans are able to make such judgments consistently
and 2 the consistency of the judgment is independent of the particular base
from which it is made apparent inconsistency arising from judgments made on the
basis of abstracts remains unexplained this experiment as well as others
concerned with human evaluations of text material leave unexplored the basic
problem of providing a metric scale on which such evaluations can be measured

a semiempirical correlation based on data from nine indexes permits the
prediction of the percentage of terms in a manipulative index vocabulary which
will be used to index any given number of documents this is a function of the
total number of index entries in the system a lognormal relationship
similar to zipfs law exists between total index entries and distribution of
term usage based upon the correlation optimum vocabulary size and growth rate
can inferred as well as the most efficient arrangement of index entries in a
storage medium the results agree well with published data and appear to be
particularly useful for designers of mechanized retrieval or publication
operations

procedures for measuring the consistency of document classification are
described three subject specialists classified 997 abstracts of psychological
reports into one of eleven categories these abstracts were also mechanically
classified by a computer program using a factor score computational procedure
each abstract was scored for all categories and assigned to the one with the
highest score the three manual classifications were compared with each other
and with the mechanical classifications and a series of contingency
coefficients was computed the average reliability of manual classification
procedures was equal to 870 the correlation between automatic and manual
classification was 766

the strategy outlined in this article describes a possible aid to the
librarian for thinning a librarys stack according to the criterion of user
needs the method uses the last circulation date as a parameter of user
circulation requirements the resulting stack collection would by design
satisfy over 99 percent of the user circulation requirements and yet be of
minimum size preliminary but not yet fully validated research indicates
that the number of volumes in a librarys holdings may be reduced by 60 to 70
percent and yet satisfy well over 99 percent of the user requirements it may
also be possible to determine which books should have multiple copies in order
that user disappointment can be minimized the effective result of this
approach is that there now may be a quantitative method of maintaining the
librarys holdings at a reasonable level and in addition a reduction in the
disappointment of the user who is unable to find the book he wants because of
use by another

citation indexes to large bodies of science literature can often list far
more citing references under the known cited reference than the user can
afford the time to look up by providing some additional information beyond
the minimal association of the citing reference with the cited reference a
citation index could provide the means of the user to select from a long list
those citing references which are most relevant to his immediate search
requirement means of providing this selectivity are discussed particular
attention is given to the possibility of adding short codes to the citation
entries which would be informative of the way in which the citing publication
is operationally related to the cited one this method is an integral feature
of the shepards legal citations a scheme of citation relationships of
potential value to users of science literature is presented these
relationships were tested on a sampling of physics literature the suggested
categories include indicators of the relation of the citing reference to the
scientific process in general as well as indicators of its relationship to the
cited reference in particular assignment of the categories to a citation
requires the exercise of judgment as in subject indexing but does not involve
the use of subject terminology an illustration is provided of the application
from a citation index to physics literature

computer dissemination of information offers significant advantages over
manual dissemination because the computer can use strategies that are
impractical and in some cases impossible for a human this paper describes
the ames laboratory selective dissemination of information system with emphasis
on the effectiveness of user feedback the system will accept any document
abstract keyword etc in a kwic or science citation index source format
user profiles consist of words or word clusters each with an initially
assigned significance value these values are used in making the decision to
notify a user that he may be interested in a particular document according to
responses the significance values are increased or decreased and quickly
attain an equilibrium which accurately describes the users interests the
system is economical compared to other existing sdi systems and human
intervention is negligible except for adding and deleting profile entries

this report describes a method of indexing documents which is based on the
assumptions 1 that a subset of the words in a document can be an effective
index to that document and 2 that this subject can be approximated by
selecting those words from the document whose frequencies are statistically
unexpectedly high the results of the experiment are encouraging although not
definitive because any index set chosen must be tested by using it for
retrieval from a large collection

the original aim of this study was to obtain objective data bearing on the
much argued question of whether author indexing is good author indexing of
285 documents reporting biomedical research was scored by comparing the author
supplied terms author set for each paper with a criterion set of terms that
was established by asking a group of 12 potential users to describe the same
document terms in the document title title set were scored similarly the
average author set contained almost half of all the terms employed by more than
one member of the user group and scored 73 of the maximal possible score as
compared with 44 for the average title set when judged by the method and
criterion employed here author indexing is substantially better than indexing
derived from document titles the findings suggest that indicia supplied by an
author should serve scientists in biomedical disciplines other than his own
about as well as they serve his disciplinary colleagues the general method
developed for measuring indexing quality may represent a practical yardstick of
wide applicability

disagreements about the relevance of documents to retrieval requests occur
because relevance judges differently interpret requests of documents requests
may be differently interpreted because they are unclear wellknown types of
request obscurity are reviewed less well known is that a request may be
unclear because its form  documents about subject s document answering
question q etc  is unclear
explications are developed of the meanings of the request forms just given
and several others a request of any of the forms discussed is interpreted to
be for documents which support statements of a specified kind in a specified
way examples are given which suggest that some perhaps all about s
requests are unclear some ways of formulating clear question requests are
given
various ways in which documents may support statements are distinguished

a measure of document retrieval system performance called the expected

as precision and recall that have been suggested by other workers the new
measure is based on calculations of the expected number of irrelevant documents
in the collection which would have to be searched through before the desired
number of relevant documents could be found its advantages are 1 it
provides a single index of the property it attempts to measure 2 it allows
for gradations of retrieval status through the mathematical concept of a weak
ordering 3 it evaluates retrieval performance relative to random searching
and 4 it takes into account the amount of relevant material desired by the

a principle of sequential optimization in search theory distributes the
search effort at each stage so as to maximize the probability of target
detection with the effort expended thus far as an application of this
principle to the search of pertinent items in a literature file the file items
should be arranged in decreasing order of the probability that an item will
yield the information sought complete ordering in this manner may not be
feasible and it is proposed that the files be partially ordered in search
zones with some loss in search efficiency a model for assessing the relative
efficiency for partial ordering is developed and used to determine optimal zone
sizes under an assumed target distribution pattern in this way tradeoff
between file organization effort and search effort can be meaningfully
evaluated a representative target distribution function for search literature
appears to follow the bradford law of scattering this function is used to
demonstrate the application of the model over a meaningful range of parameters
obtained from empirical studies it is shown that a good twozone search plan
to scientific literature is one in which 1520 of the most useful documents
are examined first only about one of three searches should have to go on to a
search over the remainder of the file

deals with the concept upon which the ucla system is based and the manner in
which the system is maintained in daytoday operations of the ucla biomedical

publication pattern discussed in the earlier article has been used to
produce a different idea in computer control of serials publication pattern
information which is entered into the master record for each title causes
checkin cards for the next expected issue of each title to be generated by the

the periodical eye research literature questions were collected from eye
researchers and a selected group of these were searched in nine different
secondary sources articles thought to be relevant were xeroxed and sent to
the eye researchers who subsequently rated the articles articles of eye
research interest are found in a wide variety of journals but a small number
of journals carry a large proportion of the articles judged valuable by the eye
researchers approximately a fourth of eye research articles are in foreign
languages translations are not readily available despite a delay of more
than 15 month between the original appearance of article in journals and the
mailing of photocopies about half of the articles of interest to the
researchers were not known to them previously for extensive retrospective
searches more than one secondary service must be used index medicus and
excerpta medica section 12 or ophthalmic literature would be good sources
medlars demand searches were not shown to be clearly superior to manual
searches of index medicus titles abstracts and full text were shown to be
equally effective in permitting searches to retrieve references that were
subsequently rated as relevant by the researchers a searcher with a background
in ophthalmology was able to retrieve more articles of research interest than
other nonophthalmologist searchers

an aspect of the human use of information that has generally been overlooked
in the automation in information services is the human tendency to locate
information spatially computerbased systems do not necessarily assign any

previous applications of simulation to information storage and retrieval
systems isrs have been overly restrictive in their scope and have failed to
consider the environment within which such systems operate this paper
considers the isrs as a subsystem within a larger system which includes the
users and the funders of the retrieval system the three components form a
closedloop information feedback system in which user response influences both
the funding and operation of the isrs as it attempts to satisfy user needs
within a finite budget allocation rewardcost theory provides the basis for
describing user behavior an industrial dynamics model has been developed to
simulate isrsuserfunder behavior where a university departmental library is
the isrs component the results which such an analysis can produce are

i better understanding of subject document retrieval might result if
different functions of subject document retrieval system are studied
separately this paper is concerned with retrieval of documents in response
to a question from which answers to that question can be inferred
answerproviding documents answer can be inferred from document has
many possible meanings one of which must be selected an inference
specification inasmuch as scientists in a field disagree about the
correctness of inferences have somewhat different background knowledge etc
any inference specification can only approximate scientific inference
practices two sources of systematic knowledge of documentstatement inference
practices in a scientific field are described ii if a content word occurs
in a question then it occurs in any answer to that question with some
apparently tractable exceptions an indexing procedure based on that fact is
described which would permit retrieval of all answerproviding documents for a
question however because the indexing is nonrelational it could cause
false retrievals as well various ways of dealing with such false retrievals
are briefly indicated and a study is sketched that would provide data for
helping selection among them two special point concerning indexing for
retrieval of answerproviding documents are discussed separately

differences the results of this comparison were fairly clearcut
characterizations in each case of relevant and partially relevant abstracts
these characterizations were found to be expressible largely as meaningful

the smart automatic document retrieval system is used to study association
procedures for automatic content analysis the effect of word frequency and
other parameters on the association process is investigated through examination
of related pairs and through retrieval experiments associated pairs of words
usually reflect localized word meanings and true synonyms cannot readily be
found from first or second order relationships in our document collections
there is little overlap between word relationships found through associations
and those used in thesaurus construction and the effects of word associations
and a thesaurus in retrieval are independent the use of associations in
retrieval experiments improves not only recall by permitting new matches
between requests and documents but also precision by reinforcing existing
matches in our experiments the precision effect is responsible for most of
the improvement possible with associations a properly constructed thesaurus
however offers better performance than statistical association methods

according to three interest patterns i the total collection of 1469
article titles a potentially useful set ii a subset concerning only his
research speciality and iii a subset of articles defined as useful for
each pattern journals were ranked by frequency of use and a scatter diagram

patterns i and ii largely resembled patterns obtained by counting citations
in basic journals or by counting publications of selected researchers pattern
iii was more widely scattered it is concluded that access to diverse
journals is needed by researchers to supply new ideas and that this diversity
of reading is not reflected adequately by citation counting or other indirect
means

agree better with composite lists produced by panels of human indexers than do
lists produced by five statistical criteria previously suggested and also
better than lists produced by most of the individual panel members the method
makes use of both the indocument wordoccurrence frequency and the incorpus
relative occurrence frequency as measures of word importance each statistical
criterion was compared with the performance of human indexers by the use of rank
correlation statistics the simple word count was found to be superior to the
other four previously suggested criteria  all of which made use of the
incorpus relative occurrence frequency the test were conducted over 19

more important terms measures of the quality of an indexers work and
exhaustivity of indexing are also proposed experimental data on indexing
consistency is presented for certain categories of indexers and consistency
quality and exhaustivity values are compared and analyzed the analysis of

it is often assumed that the amount of interindexer consistency experienced
under a given method of indexing is somehow indicative of the quality of the
indexing to explore this assumption two hypotheses are stated concerning the
possible connection between interindexer consistency and indexing quality a
specific counterexample is then exhibited which shows both hypotheses to be
invalid although a mathematical analysis of the counterexample yields certain
insights the general relationship between interindexer consistency and
successful retrieval is more subtle than might have been expected it is
concluded that until equations describing this relationship have been derived
measurements of interindexer consistency will have little meaning as clues to
indexing quality

eightytwo documents and 30 questions in documentation and related areas
was compared to find answerproviding documents documents from which answers to
questions can be inferred two judges documentation experts made
comparisons independently they discussed their disagreements attempting to
resolve them in each case the positive judge was first asked to indicate what
answer he inferred and from what document passages the further discussion
depended on the details of each case in general the resolution procedures
used will resolve a disagreement about whether a document is answerproviding
or reduce it to a familiar kind of scientific disagreement about a passages

it is pointed out that if information science is to be considered a true
science similar to physics or chemistry then it must have a set of concepts and
analytical expression which apply to the flow of information in a general way
in several previous papers the author and a colleague have described a model
of a generalized information system which has wide and perhaps universal
applicability this paper elaborates on this model and indicates the range of
its applicability several fundamental quantities are defined specifically in
a way which allows for quantification it is pointed out in this paper that
this model can be the basis for the development of a true science of
information with all of the necessary requirements for a science by the use
of this model and the definition of a true science the goals and requirements
for a curriculum in information science are thus established within this
context information is defined as data of value in decision making
quantitative measures of information can be obtained by relating information to
specific observable actions which can be measured physically

the following books and journals
for the core nursing library
suggested reference materials
and supplementary books and journals
were selected by experts in nursing
from all parts of the united states
the purpose is to let practitioners
and community hospitals
know which books and journals
from a wealth of printed material
would in the opinion of experts be
most useful especially where funds
and space are limited

with increasing scientific collaboration visibility of individual
roleperformance has diminished ordering of author names as an adaptive
device which symbolizes their relative contributions to research interviews
with nobel laureates and comparisons of their nameorder practices to those of
other scientists suggest that this symbol is ambiguous and makes evaluation of
individual roleperformance difficult a probability model of expected
distribution of name orders is used in measuring preferences for particular
sequences and these preferences vary with the authors eminence on the
assumptions that authors names are listed in order of the value of their
contributions laureates should be firstauthors more often than other
scientists in fact they are not instead they exercise their noblesse
oblige by giving credit to less eminent coworkers increasingly as their
eminence grows they do so more often after the prize and eminent
laureatestobe forego firstauthorship more often than those as yet
unrecognized the noblesse oblige however has its limits laureates
contributions to prizewinning research are more visible than contributions to
their other research

the matthew effect occurs when scientists receive differential recognition
for a particular scientific contribution depending on their
location in the stratification system merton originally introduced
the concept to explain the allocation of credit among authors of
multiple discoveries or collaborators in this paper the concept is
generalized to apply to all scientific work if the matthew effect
were to operate the reception of papers of equal quality should be
influenced by the location of their authors in the stratification system
to test this hypothesis data are drawn from several studies of
similar design in each study we control for the number of citations
papers received at time 2 this enables us to look at groups of
papers that were judged to be roughly equal in quality at time 2
we then see whether there were any differences in the reception of
these papers at time 1 depending upon various aspects of the authors
location in the stratification system all the data indicate
that assessed quality of papers at time 2 is a more important
determinant of a papers initial reception than any of the stratification
variables however the speed of diffusion of papers of equal quality
is influenced by the reputation of the author based on past work
that is being heavily utilized at the time of a new discovery the
matthew effect also operates for those scientists located at prestigious
points of the social system of science all other stratification
variables including eminence as measured by receipt of awards
did not influence the speed of diffusion data are presented that
indicate that top papers written by highranking scientists are no
more likely to be widely diffused early than are top papers by low
ranking scientists the matthew effect also serves to focus
attention on the work of littleknown men who collaborate with
scientists of high repute and to increase retroactively the visibility
of the early work of scientists who go on to greater fame a discussion
is included of the relevance of these data for the study of
resistance to scientific discoveries

in most libraries most users face a complex monolithic arrangement
of entries in catalogs and books on shelves in classical librarianship no
effort can be made to personalize the listing of titles or arrangement of
volumes for an individual user a user is unidentified and except for
that small fraction of a percent who consult reference librarians users
remain nameless
the computer however with its superb ability to treat users as
individual persons and events as individual events possesses the potential
for enabling big libraries to recapture the human qualities of
which classical librarianship has deprived them since their days as
onelibrarian libraries however rehumanization is not the only
contribution computerization will make to libraries
developments in modern society are forcing libraries to establish new
objectives contemporary living is information based a phenomenon
that is outmoding the venerable concept of library function as small special
libraries already do all libraries must participate in the cultural
activities of the individuals in their communities rather than
merely make available a torpid service libraries must look forward to
supplying information to a user when and where he needs it  an
objective impossible to attain with classical library techniques

sometimes it seems as if the library world has divided into two camps those
who seem to know all about this thing called oclc and who keep popping that
rounded acronym into their conversation with a certain bromidic effervescence
and the other camp  plain folk who are happy to take library life one
acronym at a time as they need it and who if pressed might guess that oclc
has something to do with oh optical codes at the library of congress
only in ohio  where the ohio college library center began and where
this national computerized bibliographic data exchange continues to grow 
is oclc universally a library household term even among computerphobes in
ohio most librarians already realize the kind of thing going on at oclc is
not simply the building up of someone elses data base in little bits and bytes
but perhaps the biggest revolution in access to library collections since books
were unchained from the shelves

this book is the result of a collaborative effort extending over seven
years we have tried hard to make the book a genuine joint product
to which each of us made the contributions he is best qualified to
make there is no senior author the sequence of name is simply
alphabetical and we have reversed it in signing the preface and elsewhere
to emphasize this fact our collaboration was motivated by our shared
interest in social stratification our common concern with advancing
scientific social theory on the basis of systematic research and the
conviction that the inquiry would benefit from the different qualifications
and viewpoints the two of us represent there can be no doubt
that our interests in and approaches to sociological problems differ to
a considerable degree although we agree that refining research methods
and advancing social theory are both important for example it is
only fair to state that duncan lays more stress on deriving theoretical
generalizations

the united states has been engaged in activities known
variously as technical assistance technical cooperation or
development assistance for the past twentyfive years this
form of foreign aid either government sponsored or privately
supported is a twentieth century phenomenon the broader
concept foreign aid or foreign assistance means providing
another country with any kind of goods whether financial
commodity or manpower to almost any purpose and
extends to antiquity technical assistance which may be
defined on the other hand as the supplying of techniques
is an outgrowth of the industrial revolution and parallels
americas rise in the nineteenth century to world recognition
as an important industrial and trade power government use
of such aid as an instrument of foreign policy as well as
the integration of these private and public efforts in the foreign
assistance field began to develop under president roosevelts
good neighbor policy this integration soon expanded under

the recent upsurge of interest in the behavioral aspects of scientific and
technical communication and information flow has two distinct sources a
theoretical one in the development of communication research and a practical
one in the concerns of policy makers in scientific organizations and
information services
for some time past the attention of sociologists and social psychologists
studying communication processes once focused on socalled mass phenomena
and mass publics has turned to the interplay of communication processes with
more and more definitely delineated and mapped aspects of social structure
one aspect of this shift in interest has been the increasing attention paid by
behavioral scientists to the systems supplying information of a specialized
sort and to the publics which are consumers of this specialized information
the scientific and applied professions have been most prominent among the
publics so studied

the preceding papers have addressed themselves
to the study of information flow in a particular
stream of human activity which has been variously called
science pure science basic research or
fundamental research and which
is only secondarily if at all concerned
with the practical utilization of its products
at this point it is appropriate to note that there is
a parallel activity which includes applied research
exploratory development and engineering development
this second stream of research we will call technology
far more is known about the flow of information
among scientists than among technologists from
the knowledge that is available however we are
led to conclude that the communication patterns
in the two areas of activity are not only largely
independent of one another but qualitatively
different in their nature this difference is
reflected most clearly in the mechanisms by
which information is diffused within the two
sets of practitioners the present paper is
addressed to these differences and to a discussion
of the nature of the communication process between
science and technology

the aforementioned studies are related to the
problem of information exchange in psychology
journals are a part of the formal channel of scientific
communication as well as storage elements for
the summary accounts of research undertakings
analysis of bibliographical citations thus can
reveal certain characteristics of the pattern of
information flow created by scientists in their
work the potential usefulness of this type of
investigation is increased when it becomes
possible to examine the trends through time of the
communication network under consideration and also
when different communication networks can be compared
the present paper deals with some of the
characteristics of bibliographical citations in the
same 21 psychological journals published both in
1950 and in 1960 the list of journals used along
with the abbreviations to be used here is given in
table 1 it includes 8 journals published by the
american psychological association and 13 journals
published by other organizations

there is considerable apprehension today
within the scientific community over the
communication crisis in science the present
article which attempts to clarify certain aspects
of the problem overviews the data collected by the

psychology together with data which we have
more recently obtained relative to other disciplines
such a reexamination of the data should help to
clarify apas relationship to the many information
media involved in the communication process
which begins with research and ends with the
incorporation of research findings into psychological
knowledge

we can only guess what historians of the
future will say about the condition of
presentday sociology but it seems
safe to anticipate one of their observations
when the trevelyans of 2050 come to write that
history  as they well might for this clan
of historians promises to go on forever 
they will doubtless find it strange that so
few sociologists and historians of the
twentieth century could bring themselves
in their work to treat science as one of the
great social institutions of the time they
will observe that long after the sociology of
science became an identifiable field of
inquiry it remained little cultivated in a
world where science loomed large enough to
present mankind with the choice of destruction
or survival they may even suggest
that somewhere in the process by which social
scientists take note of the world as it is
and as it once was a sense of values appears
to have become badly scrambled

the uninterrupted growth of a scientific field depends upon the existence of
a scientific community permanently devoting itself to the field therefore the
new idea is not sufficient to start the takeoff into sustained growth in a new
field a new role must be created as well in scientific psychology this
occurred in the late nineteenth century in germany using germany as a
positive case and france britain and the united states as negative cases it
is shown that the new role resulted from academic career opportunities favoring
the mobility of practitioners and students of psychology into other fields and
from the relatively low academic standing of speculative philosophy and its
consequent receptivity to persons and ideas which promised to turn the study of
the human mind into an experimental science

the relationship between the quantity and quality of scientific output of
120 university physicists was studied although these two variables are highly
correlated some physicists produce many papers of little significance and
other produce a few papers of great significance the responses of the
community of physicists to these distinct patterns of research publication were
investigated quality of output is more significant than quantity in eliciting
recognition through the receipt of awards appointment to prestigious academic
departments and being widely known to ones colleagues the reward system
operates to encourage creative scientists to be highly productive to divert
the energies of less creative physicists into other channels and to produce a
higher correlation between quantity and quality of output in the top departments
than in the weaker departments

nobel laureates in science publish more and are more apt to collaborate than
a matched sample of scientists interviews with 41 of 55 laureates and
comparison of their research output with the output of the matched sample
indicate that these patterns hold at every stage of the lifeworkcycle as
laureates report and as their publications collaborate they exercise noblesse
oblige in arranging coauthorship in collaborative publications receipt of
the nobel prize is followed by declining productivity and changed work
practices as a result of changed role obligations and activities reductions
in productivity are more severe for laureates who experience comparatively
large increments in prestige through the prize than for those who were already
eminent the prize generates strain in collaborative associations so that most
of these terminate soon after the award

the paper contains an analysis of several aspects of the communication
process in science using data obtained from printed sources and questionnaires
mailed to university physicists the conditions making for high visibility of a
scientists work are studied four strong determinates of visibility were
found the quality of work as measured by citations the honorific awards
received for work in physics the prestige of the physics department to which
the scientist belong and speciality quantity of output age and
nameordering patterns on collaborative papers have no independent effect on
visibility just as some physicists may be easily seen ie have high
visibility other are in positions where they may easily see this latter
characteristic is called awarenessthe data indicate that awareness is high
in all sectors of the population studied variables such as age rank of
department and quality of work made for only minor differences in awareness
we conclude that the communication system in physics operates efficiently

the existence of social organization within a research area may be inferred
a if scientists who have published in the area have more social ties with one
another than with scientists who have not published and b scientists who
have published in the area can be differentiated by degree od social
participation within the area using the mail questionnaire sociometric data
on different types of scientific relationships were obtained from scientists
all of whom had published in a particular problem area respondents chose
scientists who had not published in the area as often as they chose scientists
within the area analysis of direct and indirect ties using clemans method
for analysis of sociometric connectedness revealed that a tie with one or more
of the highly productive scientists brought other scientists of less
productivity into a large network of influence and communication similarities
between this type of social organization and that of the social circle are

in a rapidly advancing scientific discipline new contributions will
supersede older ones this selection in favor of recent literature should be
observable in the distribution of footnote citations in a given discipline by
age of article cited however the age distribution of citations also depends
on the rate of growth of the disciplinary literature the effect of growth of
the literature and of selection favoring recent articles can be separated if
certain assumptions hold by use of an exponential model that expands and
clarifies earlier findings by price this model provides a reasonably good fit
to agedistributions of footnotes in several disciplines and its application
suggest that citations in sociology tend to refer to older articles than those
in the natural sciencesa parameter in the model measuring the degree of
selectivity in favor of recent articles can be estimated and may be useful in
comparative studies of the communication systems of various disciplines

kuhns concept of paradigm suggests that academic disciplines could be viewed
as technologies involving degree of task predictability a series of hypotheses
were developed in which relatively high paradigm development in a discipline was
predicted to facilitate research and teaching through improved processes of
communication and access to stored information using questionnaire data
collected from 80 university graduate departments physicists and chemists were
found to exhibit more agreement over field content and to be more willing and
satisfied to spend time with graduate students than sociologists and political
scientists in addition chemists were found to collaborate with larger
numbers of graduate students in research than scientists in the other fields
two other aspects of scientific structure are discussed the level of innovation
being pursued within a field of a given time and the degree of
institutionalized differentiation of the field into subdisciplines

the highly skewed distributions of productivity among scientists can be
partly explained by a process of accumulative advantage because of feedback
through recognition and resources highly productive scientists maintain or
increase their productivity while scientists who produce very little produce
even less later on a major implication of accumulative advantage is that the
distribution of productivity becomes increasingly unequal as a cohort of
scientists ages crosssectional survey data support this hypothesis for
chemists physicists and mathematicians who show strong linear increases in
inequality with increasing career age this increase is highly associated with
a changing distribution of time spent on research another implication of
accumulative advantage is also corroborated the association among productivity
resources and esteem increases as career age increases

scientists descriptions of their research and the orientations that underlie
those descriptions 2 social status in science and 3 the formal social
categories of science ie discipline department and research organization
each of the observed structures is contrasted with a random model neither
social status nor the formal social categories show greater association on the

the problem of assessing the quality of scientific
publications has long been a major impediment to
progress in the sociology of science most researchers
have typically paid homage to the belief that quantity of
output is not the equivalent of quality and have then gone
ahead and used publication counts anyway coler 1963
crane 1965 price 1963 wilson 1964 there seemed
to be no practicable way to measure the quality of large
numbers of papers or the lifes work of large numbers of
scientists the invention of the science citation index
sci a few years ago provides a new and reliable tool
to measure the significance of individual scientists
contributions starting in 1961 the sci has listed all
bibliographic references appearing in an increasingly large
number of journals the number of citations an
individual receives may be tabulated and used as an indicator
of the relative scientific significance or quality of that

as a statistic to help describe library user circulation requirements some
decision rules were developed to use this parameter as an aid in determining the
number of copies of books to be held in the library and as an aid in the
weeding of books from the librarys holdings the effect of these decision
rules on the circulation requirements of users as well as on library operations
are described the method of data collection is described in detail and is
applicable at libraries having comparable charging systems cumulative
distribution functions of last circulation date at two large college libraries

medium is the message we must concern ourselves with not only the
means of document dissemination but also the content and value of
the documents we disseminate this idea is prevalent throughout

amounts of information is becoming a dominant theme in the management
of our way of life we are a technologically oriented society and
we have naturally turned to our communications technology to help
us perform our enormous information transfer task beginning with

in spite of concerns expressed in the literature about
the health and vigor of the field of information science and
of its serviceoriented institutions  libraries and information
centers  the progress reviews in this volume provide grounds for
optimism some of the trends that were commented on in volume 6
have proved to be solid and important for example the movement
toward rapid interactive access to major public and commercial data bases
is not very strong and it will probably not be many years before
satisfying experience with this new mode of information access will
help it become not merely an experimental innovation but the
standard means of searching and using centrally or regionally
held data three chapters in this volume touch on related aspects
of the movement bennetts review of the user interface in interactive
systems gechmans report on machinereadable bibliographic data bases and
brandhorst and eckerts review of document retrieval and dissemination
systems
this volume also introduces a new annual review topic of potentially
great importance for future libraries video cartridges and cassettes
it is widely accepted that libraries and information centers will in
the coming years shift the balance of their holdings in the direction of
some of the newer media and the chapter by kletter and hudson helps to define
the potential and problems of some of the promising new media other new
areas of interest are information system applications in the criminal
justice system and information system applications in the humanities
in addition to these topics this volume covers three of the core areas
of information science which we attempt to review on as close to an
annual basis as possible information needs and uses document description
and representation and organization of information this
coverage is consistent with a newly developed annual review master
plan for cyclic but flexible coverage of some 40 major areas of interest

the major trends of the 1970s in information system planning and
services are becoming clear as indicated in this years annual review
chapters the movement toward interinstitutional operations or networking
began gaining force in the 19651970 period through the establishment
of many new library consortia and there were some tentative efforts
to use computers for nationwide bibliographic information utilities
these movements are now more vigorous and are showing signs of being
costeffective productive ventures interinstitutional cooperation not only
promises service improvements and cost reductions but also poses new
problems and demands formalized cooperation among different institutions
requires agreement about needs and priorities and gives special importance
to a clear understanding of the information needs of specific user
subgroups it also requires more careful and productive system planning
and design including intelligent consideration of the make versus buy
issue several chapters in this volume touch on these problems and
considerations
one of the most significant developments in 1973 was the rapid growth
in the use of online information retrieval services  both those operated
by the federal government and those operated by the private sector the
apparent costeffectiveness of these services is raising some of the same
problems for data base producers that interinstitutional cooperation among
library and information facilities is raising for the publishers of printed
materials namely how to cover rising costs in the face of declining or less
rapidly growing sales of individual units of the product  monographs
serials secondary information publications or magnetic tapes the
inclusion of a chapter on copyright  the first in the annual review series 
reflects the importance of this topic in the growing controversy over the
ownership and distribution of information another aspect of that
controversy  the role of government and nonprofit information services
in relation to those of private industry  is explored in this years

this is the first annual review chapter entitled use of machine
readable data bases therefore the coverage provided is for more than
a oneyear period a chapter by gechman 79 on machinereadable
bibliographic data bases included literature from 1969 through 1971 a
chapter by housman 100 covered the use of data bases for selective
dissemination of information sdi and a chapter by parkins  kennedy
153 has previously reviewed secondary information services this
chapter will cover the 1973 literature on data bases as well as earlier
data base papers not treated in prior chapters
for purposes of this chapter a data base is considered to be an
organized set of machinereadable records containing bibliographic
or documentrelated data

the cojoining of design with evaluation that is called for by this
chapter posed organizational and inclusionexclusion problems for the
author in part design and evaluation prescribe two separate sets
of activities the former pertaining to the planning development and
testing of new information system structures and modification of existing
structures the latter to appraisals and assessments of operational
systems and system components however design includes not only the
formulation of goals and objectives for systems but also provisions for
evaluation in accordance with expectations evaluation applies to
testing design concepts and to trying out preliminary implementations
for the purpose of improving initial designs as well as to the
appraisal of operating systems appraisals at any stage of system
operability may yield data that indicate the need for system modifications
that require redesign and assessment thus portions of design and
evaluation are closely interrelated as katter demonstrated in
his 1969 review
design and evaluation may be examined methodologically or with
respect to outcomes of the application of methodologies increasingly
designers and evaluators have been acknowledging the dependence of
outcomes on sound procedural conceptualizations the current literature
discloses research on the processes of design and evaluation as well as on
their products

this chapter continues the coverage of the generation and use of
machinereadable data bases inaugurated in volume 9 by williams 178 it
is therefore an update consisting primarily of 1974 material and is prepared
in general accordance with williamss initial compilation
the same definition of data bases and the boundaries of their applications
used in volume 9 are continued this year a data base is considered
to be an organized collection of machinereadable records containing
bibliographic andor documentrelated data eg index information
the data bases that we will consider are used for information storage
and retrieval andor research in information storage and retrieval or
data base generation
the choice of these constraints precludes coverage of several areas first
data bases primarily concerned with numerical or other nonbibliographic
information such as chemical structures milen et al 112 are excluded
thus even though the chemical abstracts service cas registry number
is a data element common to many bibliographic data bases papers such as
that by cas regarding progress in building the registry system itself 39
are excluded similarly though some textual and bibliographic material
is included in the systems consultants inc report 156 to the navy most
of the information retrieval is concerned with miniaturized hardware in a
shipboard environment and thus is not considered within the scope of this
chapter finally though many of the data bases are used for generation
of publications via phototypesetting we are not considering that production
operation

international cooperation in the processing sharing and transfer of
scientific and technical information takes many forms and can be
accomplished through many agencies this chapter proposes to review
the role played by international organizations in stimulating and
providing channels and mechanisms for such cooperation the international
organizations to be discussed are of two types intergovernmental organizations
igos in which member nations participate through their governments under
formal treaties or agreements and nongovernmental organizations ngos
where with some exceptions participation is through national professional
societies or nongovernmental institutions the specialized agencies of the
united nations including unesco fall in the first category organizations
such as the international federation for documentation fid are in the
second

over the past 15 or 20 years a new and growing field of inquiry
has begun to take shape this field which will be referred to as information
science and technology draws on fragments and fringes of a number
of sciences technologies disciplines arts and practices the element
that provides whatever degree of cohesiveness now exists in the field is a
shared deep concern with information  its generation transformation
communication storage retrieval and use
because of the universality of information processes and also because
of the variety of backgrounds of those concerned with them there is very
little agreement about the boundaries of information science and technology
or about its parentage its essential nature or its future to put it
simply at the present time there is no clearly defined and wellunderstood
field of information science and technology there is not truth to tell
even clear agreement on what the word information itself means and
particularly on whether it implies a creative act of the intellect or a
commodity that can be embodied in documents transported and exchanged
distressing as this ambiguity and lack of agreement may be they need
not and do no preclude a constructive review of topics of current interest
to users designers and students of information systems and services
the purpose of the adi annual review series initiated in this volume
is to provide such a review

the way in which scientists and engineers make use of the information
systems at their disposal the demands that they put to them the
satisfaction achieved by their efforts and the resultant impact on their
further work are among the items of knowledge which are necessary for the wise
planning of science information systems and policy besides these
matters can be of great significance to the behavioral scientist interested
in human organization and communication while user studies have
not yet gone very far in serving either of these functions the end of 1963
seems to have been something of a takeoff point for empirical research
on the information needs and uses of scientists and technologists for
this first volume of the annual review we shall therefore cover studies that
made their appearance as far back as the last month of 1963 to give the
reader a rounded picture of a period during which this area of research
has witnessed progress along the following lines
substantial advances in the more systematic and fruitful application
of a technique critical incidents that had made its appearance in
this field earlier in less rigorous forms
the introduction of at least two very promising approaches solution
development records comparison of research teams working on identical
tasks quite different from any that had been applied to this field before
and
an increase in the number of efforts at comprehensive study of the
informationflow situation in given disciplines one of which american
psychological association 3 has become the model and envy of research
in this area

this volume is the second in a series of annual reviews of progress in the
field of information science and technology like its predecessor it
attempts to describe compare and evaluate the most significant work that
has been reported in the field during the past year the effort has been
undertaken in the belief that such taking stock of accomplishments provides
a valuable service to the specialists in the information science field
the chapters on new techniques for publication and distribution of
information on new developments in chemical documentation and on applications
in medicine

testing and evaluation three tasks will be undertaken to outline in
some detail the few substantive research projects involving testing and
evaluation to describe a number of research projects in areas cognate to
testing and evaluation and finally to provide some general conclusions
with respect to past and future activity although a distinction is made
in this review between laboratorybased experimentation and tests of
operational systems the methodology used in each instance is substantially
the same as yet no fullscale and elaborate field approach has been
attempted

this review has selected for emphasis reports on concepts of systems
analysis and on the procedures for applying these concepts to the design
of information systems literature dealing with the automation of libraries
and information centers has been explicitly excluded while material on
user studies file organization evaluation etc is only mentioned briefly
since it is covered more thoroughly in other chapters
the selected relevant and available literature that has been published
in the last year or so is organized into four groups as follows
1 articles that help define the process of systems analysis and
the relationship to information science
2 articles that describe the concepts of systems analysis as
applied to the analysis and design of information systems

the annual review of information science and technology is now in its
third year like its two predecessors this volume attempts to describe and
evaluate the most significant work that has been reported in the field
during the past year with the ultimate aim of improving both our standards
and our means of professional communication
the field of information science and technology continues to evolve and
grow as it does new areas of interest emerge and established areas of
interest change in importance accordingly our pattern of coverage
changes the single chapter on automation in libraries and information
centers in volume 2 has been expanded into two chapters one covering
automation of technical processes and the other covering document
networks and a new chapter has been added on information system
applications in education such applications are important not just because
they involve in part libraries and other information facilities but
because they highlight innovative ideas and techniques that should be of
value to anyone interested in the total communication process
at the same time core chapters of the review are continued information
needs and uses content analysis specification and control file organization
and search publication and distribution techniques automated language
processing manmachine communication information system design and evaluation
and professional aspects of information science
these topics are of continuing and vital interest to our readers and their
annual literature is significant large and growing

information science meets behavioral science in the study of information
needs and uses at first the meeting of these fields was inconclusive until
the mid1960s there were only a few substantial studies of information
needs and uses since about 1963 however a significant literature has
grown rapidly
there is evidence now of a productive entente between the fields
when information scientists see reliable valid and nontrivial data on
users behavior they begin to use behavioral criteria in evaluating
information system performance when behavioral scientists glimpse the
full complexity of dissemination documentation storage and retrieval
processes they offer fewer naive solutions to the information problem
this mutual education and accommodation will undoubtedly continue
information science and behavioral science need each other big science
needs them both

this the fourth volume of the annual review of information science and
technology is both like and unlike its predecessors the basic objective 
to provide the most comprehensive and technically sound progress review
ever prepared in the information science field  remains the same as do the
basic areas of interest and coverage too the primary emphasis continues
to be on published literature and reports to permit the reader to identify
locate and examine interesting and important sources of information
about various aspects of our technical progress
some new areas of growing importance are introduced this year for the
first time a chapter on reprography and microfilm technology and one on
the international aspects of information transfer have been included also
the topics of document dissemination and the secondary services usually
covered in parts of other chapters have full and separate chapters this
year another change made in response to suggestions from readers for better
signposts within each volume is the division of the book into several
major segments each introduced by a short description of the contents of
the section the relationships among the chapters within it and in some
instances one or two highlights of the years technical progress

previous authors in this series writing on this subject have usually felt
it necessary to begin with a statement concerning the state of the
methodology of user studies they have for the most part found it
improved over the past and this year is no exception in that regard
there remains however the tendency on the part of many who are untrained
in social science methodology to assume that the art of questionnaire design
and administration is a very simple one that anyone with intelligence can
master in a single attempt one never realizes how truly wrong this view is
until he finds himself the author of a review chapter and is then confronted
with the sort of trivia that many authors submit as research papers

the field of information science and technology continues to grow
and as it grows to show new emphases and explore new areas of interest
volume 5 reflects these changes the increasing interest in
and movement toward library networks and other cooperative
technologysupported information activities have helped to focus
special attention not only on data processing and microfilm technology
the two traditional mainstays of library and documenthandling systems
but also on the rapidly developing capabilities in modern telecommunications
thus a chapter on communication technology has appeared for the first
time to bring readers up to date on changes in the communications industry
that have had or will have a great impact on how we design and use
informationhandling systems
two other firsttime chapters cover management information systems
and information systems in state and local government while
the intent behind the development of such systems and the kinds of
services they provide is peripheral to the purposes and services of
library and documenthandling systems one often sees in these peripheral
areas some information parallels indeed one of the reasons for the
annual reviews covering one or more of these areas each year is to
help its readers exploit more fully the thinking and the problemsolving
techniques they are fostering

the application of computer technology to library and
network processes and services is not an end in itself but
rather a means of narrowing the gap between the demand
for library services and the ability of libraries to provide
those services libraries have assumed the active role of
serving the informational educational and recreational needs
of the population the size of that population grows constantly
its educational level keeps climbing and its percentage of
leisure time is increasing
the application of computer technology to libraries
especially to the manipulation of bibliographic records in
the performance of library functions is a complex process
and demands the highest level of talent of both the library
and computer professions for its accomplishment it cannot be
accomplished by either profession alone rather the design
of a library system is a team effort between librarians
computer system analysts and programmers even a
limited effort demands careful longterm planning if it is to
fit with later efforts into a cohesive whole the smallest
project will affect nearly all operations of the library for
these reasons it is necessary that all library staff have at
least a general overview of what library automation is all
about

a distinct characteristic of man is the need to communicate and
record knowledge the tools of communication have ranged from clay to
satellites civilized societies have taken great pains to place recorded
knowledge in safe places and create archives and libraries for this
purpose
the importance of recorded knowledge for survival and progress is
constantly being elevated as more and more information is presented
without information and its necessary control a society is not only
stagnant but regressive with social memory preserved and controlled
by archives and libraries a society is able to evolve to whatever future it
is destined to experience in an everchanging environment
archives were the forerunners of libraries the ancient archives
contained the best of societys accumulated knowledge and as nations
grew in wealth and security archives and libraries become symbols of a
countrys aspiration to create a better society today archives and
libraries are necessities these cultural institutions pass information to
succeeding generations in a variety of forms of distributable media in this
way archives and libraries preserve the memory of civilization and pass
this memory on to living individuals the materials in these institutions
contain the written and graphic record of social memory and human
heritage and provide society with information on which to base actions
develop policies ascertain rights educate and entertain

it is the intent of this volume to develop a model designed
to eliminate present difficulties and ambiguities and
to improve administrative procedures for future development
of area programs this will be accomplished by giving
some indication of the climate of opinion toward area specialist
bibliographers and by isolating factors which influence
these opinions these attitudes will be presented by the
perceptions of area bibliographers toward their role and the
expectations of faculty and library administrators toward that
role the bibliographers academic professional and
educational experience will be examined in this framework

the data in that survey covered the year 1971 many recipients
of the 1972 document have requested updated information accordingly
the asidic cooperative data management committee initiated a new survey
the questionnaires were mailed out in january of 1975 and responses
came in throughout the year questionnaires were sent to all member
organizations of asidic and eusidic questionnaires were also sent
to individual members of asis sigsdi and siguoi
responses received throughout 1975 were checked and tabulated in
1976 because of the time delay in producing the final compilation
the reader is warned against using this survey as an uptodate source
for information as to which centers are processing which data bases
of the 116 responding organizations 75 process data bases and
41 use data base services either as end users or as brokers of the 75
that process data bases ie spin tapes 51 68 are members of asidic
andor eusidic this survey provides representative data for data base
processing organizations the use of online search services was
relatively new in 1974 hence data regarding online users would not be
representative of the 1976 online situation

since bernal made his pilot survey of the use of scientific literature
for the 1948 royal society scientific information conference at least
three dozen other investigations have been reported of the needs of
scientists and engineers for information of their information gathering
habits and the use to which they put information
some of these have been concerned with the people in individual
organizations but have implications elsewhere others including
aslibs own investigations have had wider aims some have been
based upon observations and records of what the scientists and
engineers themselves did or said and some upon records of the demands
they made upon libraries there have been both surveys of opinions

i am going to describe in general terms a research project
which has been established to explore some of the problems of
the use of the literature particularly in the field of
biomedical engineering of the national institute for medical

a number of overlapping stages we have reached the stage now

the investigation dealt with the effect which different devices have on the
performance of index languages it appeared that the most important
consideration was the specificity of the index terms within the context of the
conditions existing in this test singleword terms were more effective than
concept terms or a controlled vocabulary

during the past year we have been one of the organizations
participating in the chemical societys experiment on the use
of routine computer searches of chemical titles ct and chemical
biological activities cbac for current awareness for some
time we have also been subscribing to the automatic subject citation
alert asca which is produced by the institute for scientific
information as a byproduct of the science citation index these
three sources differ in their scope and methods but share the
same ultimate objective of providing a computerbased current
awareness service
ct covers journals in all branches of chemistry but provides only
authors and titles the latter translated into american and edited by
breaking down complex words so that word fragments can be retrieved
cbac covers only papers on the interaction of chemical compounds with
biological systems but provides abstracts which are available for
computer search the computer can also search for molecular
formulae and for chemical abstracts registry numbers of all
compounds included in the abstracts asca in its original form
was based on citations the search profile can consist of a list of
references to older work and the output is then a list of new papers
citing this work last spring asca introduced a term search which
is a search for words in the titles of current papers and is therefore
analogous to a ct search
this paper discusses and compares the results we have obtained so
far with these three services and the potential use of systems of
this type

this review has been sponsored by the office for scientific
and technical information and the end product of the complete
research will be a thesaurus of management terms parallel research
in the business management area and also supported by osti is being
conducted by david dews librarian of the manchester business school
and kdc vernon librarian of the london graduate school of
business studies as mr vernon is at present engaged in the
construction of a faceted classification scheme for management
this investigation has concentrated on the possibility of utilizing
faceted techniques to construct such a thesaurus
a study of existing information retrieval systems in the
management field has already been made so a decision to adopt
some form of postcoordinate indexing was assumed thus a comparative
study of other systems will not be attempted a decision has also
already been made that a controlled vocabulary ie a thesaurus
was eventually going to be developed despite the latest cranfield
results that appear to provide evidence of the superiority of
natural language over controlled vocabularies this was primarily
because these results were restricted to tests on an aeronautical
collection and it may well be that the natural language of this
discipline is in itself a fairly controlled one which is
certainly not the case with the rather soft language of
management this is borne out to some extent by halkin who
quotes relevance figures for coordinate indexing applied to organic
chemistry 55 percent engineering 35 percent and social
science 20 per cent
machine methods of term generation as described by ovchinnikov
mastermann and luhn will not be considered as there is no equipment
available to prepare thesauri on the lines these authors suggest

picatinny arsenal us department of the army to perform a study aimed
at developing criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of library
operations and services under the atlis program army technical
library improvement studies the study was divided into three
phases aimed at
i a literature search to reflect the current stateofthe
art covering library standards and the methods of evaluating
libraries developed up to the present
ii a phase in which to gather and evaluate any data required from
army technical libraries from available surveys already
published or from any other sources by which to develop
criteria
iii a phase in which to establish and validate the criteria
phases i and ii of the study are now complete phase iii is in progress
and is expected to be completed by the late fall of 1968 the reports of
phases i and ii are already available for detailed study and that of
phase iii will be available soon the purpose of this paper is to present

universal decimal classification  dying duck or live bird  or some

convince you  if the bsis fine efforts have not already done so  that the
udc is by no means the dying duck  certainly not the dead duck  that some of
its severest critics seem to imagine perhaps the bird has ceased to soar as
it once did in the times of otlet la fontaine bradford and donker duyvis but
that it is still viable in the turbulent air of current documentation may be
gauged from a recent fid inquiry aimed at obtaining figures for the

the analysis of citations has often been employed to indicate the use
of the literature of science and technology citation is only an indicator
of use not an accurate measure and like all such indicators has defects
differences between indicators have been discussed elsewhere
despite these defects an examination of citations does enable one to
sample acts of literature use within a large community the study reported
here was directed in fact to all united kingdom authors of science
technology publications in a given year and because of its width and the type
of analysis performed is considered to be worth reporting the study was
primarily undertaken to obtain comparable information about social science
literature and this has been reported elsewhere

may we please raise four questions which are important at the present time
when government policy on information retrieval is being considered these
arise from results recently produced by sdc which are germane to dr
somerfields paper on computerbased information services aslib
proceedings 20 12 54250 1968 and to ostis work in this field
the sdc is making comparisons of the efficiency of various published
indexes and other sources of scientific information and the first results
of rigorously checked comparisons are becoming available for a case study
on the subject of computers related to mass spectrometry this results
from an extensive literature search prepared by combining and collating
results of searches in twelve of the worlds major indexes to chemistry and
spectroscopy including searches of sdcs own data bank files nearly
two hundred unique references on computers related to mass spectrometry
were found and are being checked individually for relevance going back
to the original paper or asking expert opinion where necessary

planning of any kind can be motivated by a pressing practical problem which
has to be solved  for example an increasing number of people may have to be
housed in the same area or by a longterm idealistic vision or by both
the idealist seeing the longterm implications of an immediate problem in
shortterm planning the danger exists that the more technical problems may be
solved without attention to their implications for human beings to take
my housing example higher and higher flats may be built without considering
the possible effects eg the effect on social groupings in longterm

for some time past interest has been developing within the aslib research
department in the problems of establishing standard costs for information
systems a literature search recently conducted by the department r
reynolds has revealed a scarcity of usable information on this subject
such data as is available is difficult to evaluate comparatively because
of the differing definitions of the operations costed and of the terms used to
describe them it would seem therefore that a first step towards developing
a costing method of widespread application would be the establishment of
standard conventions for the analysis of information systems
one might postulate two possible ways of arriving at comparative costs for
these systems namely
a general survey method the overall costs of a large number of information
systems are broken down into a small number of categories and analysed
for correlation see for example cj wessel et al
b indepth study a small number of systems are studied in detail in an
attempt to establish the true sources of the costs and factors affecting
them
in a current project we are attempting to apply method b to the production
of currentawareness bulletins an outline of some of the preliminary work in
this project follows

i see from the programme that i am supposed to talk on an information
language for marc and it is true that the work i have been doing for the past
year or so has been under the auspices of the marc project but the subject
indexing system we have developed is concerned as much with bnbs plans for
computer production from 1971 as with the marc tapes as such and i hope to
show that we have also gone some way towards developing a compatible
general system with even wider application before coming to this however it
is necessary to describe briefly some of the day to day pressures of work which
caused bnb to look to the computer for help from this we can see how the
computer forced us to reconsider our whole approach to subject indexing

in a university the mode of research is usually what is called pure or
basic research since i am keeping in mind primarily the applications of
information science i will prefer the word basic although there is not so
much difference in such research and really in any good research one should
not be collecting data haphazardly one must isolate and define a problem and
as far as possible control other conditions so that interfering factors are
eliminated preferably one will narrow down the problem to manageable
proportions it is then essential to approach the problem with some sort of
hypothesis or theory of the situation and to concentrate on obtaining
evidence for or against that hypothesis the important task is to devise just
that crucial experiment which will give the answer as efficiently as possible
if the answer disproves the hypothesis one has at least further evidence upon
which to construct a different hypothesis if it confirms the hypothesis one
is ready for a further step forward and so on research is easier in a
fully controlled and reproducible situation in a biological or human
situation one must often have recourse to statistical methods but this does
not alter the general methodology on the whole i find a clear methodology
lacking in much that is being done in the field of information science today

my terms of reference when asked to prepare this review of user studies were
to bring fishendens work up to date this was published in the journal of
documentation in september 1965 and in his paper he looks at a limited number
of british use studies and draws some broad general conclusions relating to the
development of a national information service the present paper which covers
the literature back to the beginning of 1966 is somewhat more detailed it
considers a wide range of investigations into the information gathering habits
of scientists engineers social scientists and others and reports results
which it is hoped will provide managers with information on which to develop
policies regarding library and information services at all levels although
an increasing number of studies is being carried out in eastern europe and
in the ussr there has been no major work reported and consequently the review
considers mainly british and american investigations

when infross began in the autumn of 1967 although a large number of
studies had been conducted into the requirements of scientists for information
very little had been done in the field of social science information there are
a number of possible reasons for this social scientists faced with a much
smaller total volume of information were much less informationconscious and
less inclined to seek for solutions there are very few specialist libraries
in the social sciences and few librarians were therefore confronted with
social scientists information needs in the same way as librarians in
scientific libraries were confronted with users and their problems finally
until osti came along there was little in the way of funds to support this
kind of research this almost total absence of previous research had its
disadvantages and advantages there were very few clues to guide us and we
were therefore working to a certain extent in the dark on the other hand
we had a clean and open field uncorrupted by confusing and noncomparable
studies there is something to be said for being one of the first in a field

in the context of the present symposium it would seem appropriate that
i should deal specifically with the economic aspects of selective dissemination
of information sdi operation and use in my opinion the technical
feasibility and merits of sdi have been adequately demonstrated the main
barriers hindering general use however tend to be of an economic nature
at shell research in sittingbourne we have been operating since 1967 an
sdi service for the research staff and it has grown rapidly particularly
since we started to use the ca condensates tapes early in 1969 in addition
to these tapes we are currently using the ba previews tapes agdoc tapes
prepared by ourselves using punched card input received from derwent and
on an experimental basis toxitapes produced by biosis philadelphia
all these tapes are searched locally involving the running of around five
hundred profiles weekly

successful delegated searching for publications relevant to the topic of
an inquirer obeys rules whose relations to thermodynamics are unmistakable
by the continuous growth of a documentation system in the physical and
conceptual respect steadily increasing demands are made on the degree of order
which prevails in the system or can be established at the specific request of
an inquirer if the order in a system cannot keep pace with the increasing
requirements its working capability will continuously decrease because
the searcher is becoming more and more overburdened in relation to his
available search time search patience and search memory the degree of
order attainable in a growing literature collection can be estimated on the
basis of six postulates the better the requirements imposed by these
postulates are approximated in a practical documentation system the higher
are its working capability and life expectancy but the expenditure to be
made on the literature analyses must also inevitably be higher
the establishment of these postulates originated from practical experience
with the idcsystem and its precursors these postulates form the basis
of this system and of its further development

i am sure you do not need reminding of the flood of scientific information
that is available today and the estimates of its growth in the next two
decades in 1967 olaf helmer then senior mathematician at the rand
corporation forecast that scientists and engineers would increase from
five million in 1967 to twentyfive million by the year 2000 and their
total productivity would go up by a factor of ten he declined to assess
the associated growth of and need for scientific information but merely
stated that there would be substantial changes in the way in which science
would actually be transacted it is these substantial changes that concern
the publisher editor information scientist and librarian because if we
do not anticipate  or at least keep pace with these changes  then we will
not be able to meet the information needs of our readers and we will become
redundant scientific information is a growing industry and it would be
ironic if we could not survive amid an abundance of information i regard
the chance to do something about the flow of information as a response to
opportunity not as an act of desperation the big problem is to sort out
what is pertinent among this information and in this world of rapid change
select and develop the technological devices that will match the needs of
the scientist to this mass of information

this paper describes progress which has been made toward the development of
a procedural model intended as a code of good practice to enable special
librarians to effect economies in their journal holdings by systematically
planned use of the bll
a theoretical model suggested by b c brookes was tested on various sets of
usage data from seven special libraries but the results proved to be unrealistic
in terms of immediate provision to the user a new experimental approach has
now been developed based on the total use versus total cost of a journal

the idea that a language is based on a system of rules determining
the interpretation of its infinitely many sentences is by
no means novel well over a century ago it was expressed with
reasonable clarity by wilhelm von humboldt in his famous but
rarely studied introduction to general linguistics humboldt
1836 his view that a language makes infinite use of finite
means and that its grammar must describe the processes that
make this possible is furthermore a outgrowth of a persistent
concern within rationalistic philosophy of language and mind
with this creative aspect of language use for discussion see
chomsky 1964 forthcoming what is more it seems that even
paninis grammar can be interpreted as a fragment of such a
generative grammar in essentially the contemporary sense of
this term
this monograph is an exploratory study of various problems
that have arisen in the course of work on transformational grammar
which is presupposed throughout as a general framework for the
discussion what is at issue here is precisely how this
theory should be formulated this study deals then with
questions that are at the border of research in transformational
grammar for some definite answers will be proposed but more
often the discussion will merely raise issues and consider possible
approaches to them without reaching any definite conclusions

the genesis of this book can be traced to a telephone call i
received during the fall of 1966 from dr james g miller then
director of the university of michigans mental health institute
and currently vice president for academic affairs of cleveland
state university he asked what i am sure he thought was a
relatively straightforward and easily answered question what
are the legal consequences of computerizing copyrighted materials
on closer inquiry i discovered that dr miller was exploring
the possibility of using computer technology to develop a national
multimedia information network that would electronically integrate
our colleges and universities eventually providing each of them
a comprehensive and easily accessible pool of scholarly works and
educational services he subsequently sought to breathe life into
this idea of promoting the formation of an organization called the

was given to the question of american council of education sponsorship of
an evaluation of selected graduate programs of major universities that

never any question about the need for doing in a systematic and objective
way what necessarily goes on continually in any event though usually
in a piecemeal and more impressionistic way our commission on plans
and objectives for higher education and other leading educators consulted
concluded that a thoroughgoing study should be made and that the councils

the growth of professions has been one of the sociological
phenomena of the past century as the strength of
national professional associations of practitioners has increased
concern with education for the professions has
prompted schools to develop standards and curricula to
support the preparation of practitioners during the half
century spanning 1900 the schools in many professions formed
national associations the association of american medical
colleges for example was established in 1876 other professional
school associations followed engineering 1893 law 1900
librarianship 1915 theology 1918 and social work 1919
these associations to cite a few have developed in different ways
while conforming to general patterns and have reached various lvels
of influence in affecting professional education

urges that men of science should then turn to the massive task
of making more accessible our bewildering store of knowledge

the powers of his mind trip hammers that multiply the fists
microscopes that sharpen the eye and engines of destruction and
detection are new results but not the end results of modern

developed will give man access to and command over the inherited
knowledge of the ages the perfection of these pacific instruments

this is a book about social discrimination but its purpose is not
simply to add a few more empirical findings to an already extensive body
of information the central theme of the work is a relatively new
concept  the rise of an anthropological species we call the
authoritarian type of man in contrast to the bigot of the older style
he seems to combine the ideas and skills which are typical of a highly
industrialized society with irrational or antirational
beliefs he is at the same time enlightened and superstitious proud
to be an individualist and in constant fear of not being like all the others
jealous of his independence and inclined to submit blindly to power
and authority the character structure which comprises these conflicting
trends has already attracted the attention of modern philosophers and
political thinkers this book approaches the problem with the means of
sociopsychological research

the idea for automated language processing was suggested in 1964 at a
time when the research efforts in information storage and retrieval were
expanding at system development corporation many people in the company
were directly interested in this area and an even larger group had interests
that were tangentially related a quick and effective means of acquainting
them with the stateoftheart was needed but no convenient compilation
of relevant material was available it was agreed that a book on the
theory and techniques of information storage and retrieval procedures would
be a worthwhile project for the language processing staff to undertake
although no one member could reasonably be expected to cover the entire
range of technical developments in this field the staff as a whole is
concerned with most phases of the work this is attested by the fact that
all but one of the chapter authors were connected with sdc either as
employees or consultants the single exception is pendergraft for sdc
has had no sustained project in machine translation sdc management was
enthusiastic in its support of the new project

this book is primarily a research monograph in which the discussion
of the main topics has been broadened so that they are related to their
surrounding context in information retrieval as a whole it is not a
textbook and no attempt has therefore been made to justify the choice
of topic or account for the use of certain concepts or to provide an
elementary description of either for instance in chapter 1 it is assumed
that the reader is familiar with the idea of using keywords in information
retrieval i have not considered the relation between this kind of
retrieval device and a controlled thesaurus or descriptor set or that
between the use of simple class lists as document descriptions and the
use of descriptions with a syntactic structure for example equally
in chapter 2 i have made use of recallprecision ratios as a means of
characterising retrieval performance without justification or argument
but this does not mean that i am unaware of the difficulties of doing this
or of the attention which has been devoted to and controversy which has
raged round this subject it is simply that from the point of view of
my main purpose it is reasonable to use these ratios

myself strictly to those areas which are commonly termed library
housekeeping  the processes of book ordering and cataloguing
periodicals accessioning and circulation control whose purpose is to
make a library into an efficient machine for acquiring storing and
disseminating knowledge and information these are the processes
which can be automated here and now to improve the quality of
service which a library can give to its readers i hope that the
descriptions and explanations given here will be of assistance to librarians
in developing appropriate automated systems in their own libraries

many of its operations these areas of concern well
known to librarians include mounting arrearages in

complexity of manual inventory control files
increasing difficulty in keeping card catalogues

it is easiest of all to apply mechanization and automation to the
transmission accumulation and search of information automation
can also be extended to cover some more complicated functions in
all of these cases the results supplied by automatic devices are
analysed and decisions are taken usually by man thus the role of
machine is to considerably extend mans capabilities rather than to
completely replace man
the automated systems intended to accumulate and search for information
have come to be called informationretrieval systems irs these
systems can also perform the simpler forms of data processing
the physical facilities of these systems are communications equipment
punchedcard computers microfilming equipment and electronic computers

as part of an investigation of health sciences library manpower the
universe of healthrelated institutions and programs excluding hospitals was
surveyed by postcard questionnaire to produce an inventory and description of
libraries providing services to these institutions reported access to library
resources indicating usage of some 2207 nonhospital libraries eighty
percent 2431 of the institutions reported that the library used was within
their own institution 20 percent 608 noted that the library was outside
of their institution
the distribution of healthrelated institutions and libraries is shown by
rml districts together with relevant census data a classification of
libraries based on the degree of involvement of the libraries facilities
resources and personnel in supplying services to healthrelated institutions

substantial improvement over the traditional methods of searching through the
printed indexes these respondents also stated that the results of medline
searches had assisted them in their clinical or research work or both asked
whether they would continue to use medline after the imposition of user charges

the paper reviews the highlights of a fourweek trial period november 19 
december 18 1970 during which the medical library of the university of
virginia experimented with a new remoteaccess bibliographical control and
retrieval system via its twx machine the system called aimtwx was
sponsored by the lister hill national center for biomedical communications
and utilized a timeshared ibm 36067 computer in santa monica california
citations from 109 clinicallyoriented journals from 1966 to date including
those currently included in the abridged index medicus may be retrieved
either on or offline
various aspects of this service are described including problems of
staffing training and record keeping as well as the role of the mesh
vocabulary which is the principle language of the mancomputer dialog
the statistical results indicated that the system was used for approximately
200 minuted on nineteen days and that an average of sixteen searches were run
on any given day or about 46 searches per hour of use in spite of an
inexperienced staff who had little knowledge of the mesh vocabulary and whose
training schedule was limited to one fourhour session the experiment was
highly successful in terms of searches and citations
at the end of the period 298 searches had been run for 114 requestors
and 5343 citations had been produced only fiftyfive searches yielded no
citations the experiment generated a great deal of excitement and interest
among the staff of the library and of the medical center moreover a large
number of medical practitioners in large and small communities of virginia
participated in this experiment indicating that there exists a great demand
for this type of literature searching which aimtwx is able to provide with
great rapidity

for many years administrators of library collections have sought
objective criteria for assembling wellrounded periodical collections
in the subject fields represented by their collections the nearest
approach to any criterion which does away with the a priori knowledge
of the specialist was first suggested by gross and gross in 1927 this
method consists essentially of counting the bibliographic citations at
the conclusions of the articles in a basic periodical of the field under
consideration and of arranging the journals cited in order of the
frequency of their citation thus in the field of chemistry the
references in the journal of the american chemical society are counted and
a list is made of the most frequently cited journals according to gross
and gross the journals which are cited most frequently in the journal of the
american chemical society are the most valuable journals for a library
to purchase in order to possess a wellrounded collection in chemistry
although the gross and gross method has been in use for almost twenty
years the fundamental assumptions upon which the method is based have
never been examined these assumptions are
1 the value of a periodical to a professional worker is in direct
proportion to the number of times it is cited in the professional
literature
2 the journal or journals used as the base for the tabulation are
representative of the entire field
3 if more than one journal is used as a base all of them can be weighted
equally

the sustained interest in documentation as a key to the retrieval of
information in the literature of the sciences has obscured largely the
potential utility of statistical bibliography as a method of analyzing
information needs in the belief that a discussion of the latter may be
of value to interested biomedical librarians and scientists a review of
investigative methods and results in the health sciences is offered here
statistical bibliography may be defined as the assembling and interpretation
of statistics relating to books and periodicals it may be used in a
variety of situations for an almost unlimited number of measurements
within the last forty years bibliographical statistics have been collected
and explained in several fields of science for these main purposes to
demonstrate historical movements to determine the national or universal
research use of books and journals and to ascertain in many local
situations the general use of books and journals

mechanical means for expediting library work have been considered
for many years as an examination of the early pages of library
journals bears out the very first volume of the forerunner of the bulletin
the medical library and historical journal moreover contained an
article on the use of the typewriting machine in cataloging telephones
have long been accepted as library machines and except for unusual
items hand bookbinding has given way to machinebound books
nevertheless when the term machine methods is used for libraries
today the prevailing idea is that expensive and complicated electronic
equipment must be employed and since few libraries are able to afford
such equipment for themselves it is generally assumed that none but the
largest libraries the library of congress or the national library of
medicine for example will be able to employ already existing mechanical
methods or devise systems specifically applicable to their own situations

the purpose of this investigation was to produce a title list of current
journals suppling upwards of 75 percent of demand at the columbia and yale
medical libraries columbia received nearly 2000 journals and yale over
1500 findings are based upon an analysis of canceled charge slips for issues
published from 1959 through june 1962 this combined study of recorded usage
for six months in the columbia medical library 129 percent of circulation
during january through june 1962 and for one year in the yale medical library
125 percent of 196162 circulation revealed that a core of 262 journals
supplied 80 percent of use of titles published in the 1959 to mid1962
period however it is probable that current issues of all titles received
were used at least once within the libraries titles of sixtyseven journals
which supplied slightly more than 50 percent of use are listed

users of information in science and technology have been studied in great
detail with respect to material read amount of time spent in reading and
searching the literature categories of questions asked an so on probing
for this information has been undertaken by means of structured and
unstructured interviews diaries surveys and questionnaires
although a large amount of data has emerged on information usage and flow
the subjective response of scientists furnishes comment only on the satisfaction
produced by present information services and does not yield insight into the
extent to which needs remain unsatisfied relevance figures based upon the
response of systems to questions cannot be equated with satisfaction of needs
since questions constitute in most cases inadequate representations of
underlying information needs
assessment of the needs of users of medical libraries and information system
must in fact be made in relation to the observed behavior and experience of
biomedical scientists there is room for welldesigned experimentation which
can explore the interaction of both psychological and environmental factors
significant differences in information needs exist among and between individuals
such as researches and clinicians in the same environment with respect to
environment it is hypothesized that the information needs for medical
practitioners in remote areas might differ significantly from those of their
colleagues working in large metropolitan centers in close proximity to medical
schools research institutions and other rich sources of information fallout
it is anticipated that experimentation will eventually result in a
methodology which will permit the determination and prediction of the
information needs of any identified groups of users in a specific environment

the conventionally erected and reported circulation analysis of serial use
in the individual and the feeder library is found to be statistically invalid
and misleading since it measures neither the intellectual use of the serials
contents nor the physical handlings or serial units and is nonrepresentative
of the indepth library use of serials it fails utterly to report or even to
suggest the relation of intralibrary and interlibrary serial resources the

a method of measuring a librarys capability for providing the documents its
users need has been developed the library is tested with representative
sample of such documents to determine how long would be required for users to
obtain these documents test results are expressed in terms of a capability
index which has a maximal value of 100 only if all the sample documents are
found on shelf specific tests employing samples of 300 documents have been
developed that are appropriate for academic an for reservoir biomedical
libraries realistic field trials have demonstrated that these two tests are
practical to administer and that test results are adequately reproducible
when strict comparability is not important a library can test itself in
assessing a reservoir library test results are supplemented by data on its
typical processing time for interlibrary loan requests currently these tests
are being used in a national survey the general method is applicable to other
types of libraries provided appropriate test samples are established if
their limitations are clearly understood these document delivery tests
can be valuable tools for planning and managing library services

the data by checking appropriate categories on a form this inventory
procedure covers the entire spectrum of user services and accommodates a wide
range of policies the inventory was originally designed for use by trained
interviewers in largescale surveys of academic medical libraries however
it is also suitable for other kinds of libraries and the interview guide and
checklist can be used for a selfsurvey by library stuff in addition to
survey use the inventory has a variety of educational administrative
managerial and research applications a methods for weighting the categorical
inventory data to reflect the relative desirability of different policies makes
it possible to calculate scores indicating how a librarys policies compare
with those of an optimal library an analogous inventory of the services a
library provides to other libraries was developed for surveying major backup

librarians can best serve the information needs of scientists using sdi systems

obtained on services to faculty and to medical students are presented and
commented upon comparisons with the findings of earlies surveys suggest
that increases in the stuffs and budgets of medical school libraries over the
past two decades have gone largely to supporting a rapidly increasing volume of
service rather than to any striking increase in the breadth and depth of
services to facilitate summarization and comparisons among libraries the
descriptive data were weighted and converted to quantitative measures the
weighting scheme was established by a group of five academic medical librarians
to reflect the relative values the group assigned to different services

the national biomedical communications network has evolved both from a set
of conceptual recommendations over the last twelve years and an accumulation
of needs manifesting themselves in the requests of members of the medical
community with a short history of three years this network and its developing
structure have exhibited most of the stresses of technology interfacing with
customer groups and of a structure attempting to build itself upon many
existing fragmentary unconnected segments of a potentially viable resource
sharing capability
in addition to addressing these topics the paper treats a design appropriate
to any network devoted to information transfer in a special interest user
community it discusses fundamentals of network design highlighting that
network structure most appropriate to a national information network examples

rationale behind the evaluation process although the results invariably lead
to a confused interpretation when there is no clear understanding of the
purpose of an evaluation second the total library system is rarely
considered instead each evaluation criterion is taken in isolation rather
than as part of the whole third the librarys preservation function has not

the standardized document delivery tests ddts developed earlier bulletin
56 241267 july 1968 were employed to assess the capability of ninetytwo
medical school libraries for meeting the document needs of biomedical
researchers and the capability of fifteen major resource libraries for filling
il requests from biomedical libraries the primary test data are summarized
as statistics on the observed availability status of the 300 plus documents in
the test samples and as measures expressing capability as a function of the
mean time that would be required for users to obtain test sample documents
a mathematical model is developed in which the virtual capability of a library
as seen by its users equals the algebraic sum of the basic capability afforded
by its holdings the combined losses attributable to use of its collection
processing relative inaccessibility and housekeeping problems and the gain
realized by coupling with other resources il borrowing for a particular
library or group of libraries empirical values for each of these variables
can be calculated easily from the capability measures and the status
statistics regression equations are derived that provide useful predictions
of basic capability from collection size the most important result of this
work is that costeffectiveness analyses can now be used as practical decision
aids in managing a basic library service a program of periodic surveys and
further development of ddts is recommended as appropriate for the medical
library association

the recent development of various methods of modulation such as pcm
and ppm which exchange bandwidth for signaltonoise ratio has
intensified the interest in a general theory of communication a basis for
such a theory is contained in the important papers of nyquist and hartley
on this subject in the present paper we will extend the theory to include a
number of new factors in particular the effect of noise in the channel and
the savings possible due to the statistical structure of the original message
and due to the nature of the final destination of the information
the fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at
one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another
point frequently the messages have meaning that is they refer to or are
correlated according to some system with certain physical or conceptual
entities these semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to the
engineering problem the significant aspect is that the actual message is
one selected from a set of possible messages the system must be designed
to operate for each possible selection not just the one which will actually
be chosen since this is unknown at the time of design

in this final installment of the paper we consider the case where the
signals or the messages or both are continuously variable in contrast with
the discrete nature assumed until now to a considerable extent the
continuous case can be obtained through a limiting process from the discrete
case by dividing the continuum of messages and signals into a large but finite
number of small regions and calculating the various parameters involved on
a discrete basis as the size of the regions is decreased these parameters in
general approach as limits the proper values for the continuous case there
are however a few new effects that appear and also a general change of
emphasis in the direction of specialization of the general results to
particular cases
we will not attempt in the continuous case to obtain our results with
the greatest generality or with the extreme rigor of pure mathematics since
this would involve a great deal of abstract measure theory and would
obscure the main thread of the analysis a preliminary study however
indicates that the theory can be formulated in a completely axiomatic and
rigorous manner which includes both the continuous and discrete cases and
many others the occasional liberties taken with limiting processes in the
present analysis can be justified in all cases of practical interest

that one is led to the conjecture that if these phenomena have any property
in common it can only be a similarity in the structure of the underlying
probability mechanisms the empirical distributions to which we shall refer
specifically are a distributions of words in prose samples by their
frequency of occurrence b distributions of scientists by number of papers

the essentially logistical problem of making library books physically
available when wanted by library users is central to librarianship this
book is a tentative attempt to provide a treatise on this problem as such
it has to deal with both theoretical analysis and the practicality of
solutions no apology is made for the attention devoted to theoretical
analysis because the author believes that a clear conceptual understanding
of the factors involved is important for improved librarianship the
fact that analytical models are not always usable does not mean that the
insight that can sometimes be derived from such analyses will not lead to
a better understanding of the problems and thereby to improved library

this guide is a recapitulation and refinement of the substantive
content of a oneandahalf day course which was given before
three groups of federal scientists and engineers during the fall of
1967 its purpose was to train and inform
working scientists and engineers as to the most direct and efficient
means of seeking and acquiring workrelated information
the impetus for the course was the recognition of the growing
need for working scientists and engineers to share and participate
in the existing and emerging information tools and mechanisms
and to avail themselves of the opportunities afforded by the newer
approaches to information collection organization and dissemination
a further related purpose of the course was to facilitate the
fullest possible participation of the working scientist and engineer
in the evolution of information services and mechanisms which are
likely to have a greater and greater effect on his professional
activities

mass of new publications every library must within the limit
of its funds select that small part which will be most
beneficial to the community it serves this is properly an
awesome responsibility to the young inexperienced librarian to
the competent veteran it is a task which though carried on
week after week never can approach the ease of a well

case studies in library computer systems does not follow the mode of
the other volumes in this series because none of the persons libraries or
systems is disguised neither has information been withheld to force readers
tp explore alternative choices as in the usual case method rather all
systems are identified and described as accurately as possible descriptive
case studies are problemoriented however because they analyze a situation
in which a librarian had to decide if a computer could be successfully
utilized to solve the problem at hand the descriptive case method rather
than the problem case method was chosen because it seemed important to
describe each system in detail and to evaluate its performance in the context
of a real library environment and against the background of particular
institutional service objectives

the marriage between the university of michigan library and
community systems foundation seemed like a sensible step at the
time too often library administration found it necessary to choose
between alternate courses of action without having adequate information
in addition overburdened department heads rarely found time
to alter their systems substantially to accommodate demands on the
library and their departments let alone time to make these changes
in a systematic manner which considered the impact on other
departments and carefully weighed alternative solutions as a
consequence of this situation the library administrators were
considering ways of providing staff assistance to themselves and
the department heads so that alternate courses of action could
be designed and properly evaluated

the book deals almost entirely with theory and principles only
now and then if it seems necessary to a complete understanding of
the implications of theory is some detail of practice briefly
described
it follows that the work is not a substitute for rules of entry and
description subject headings rules and lists classification schemes or
other similar reference books instead it is only a commentary on such
works and it does not profess to comment on more than a few of
what seem to be the most important aspects of each
comments are made only on cataloging in the united states
many interesting practices have always been part of cataloging
abroad but to write of these practices also would have taken several
books this work looks at the foreign scene only when it seems
necessary to understand fully some procedure in this country if a
reader in some other country finds anything in this book helpful
that will be i hope good for him and for his countrys cataloging
i am not at all sure however that what we do and think in this
country will be of value in other countries with other conditions in
no sense is this a book of american intellectual imperialism

the conference theme centered on the implications of cable television for
libraries the general purpose of the institute was to foster greater
understanding about the subject of cable television in the conference
participants more specifically the planning committee for the conference
enumerated the following objectives
1 to provide an atmosphere of inquiry focused on the implications of cable
television for libraries
2 to provide consultants and resource people who have knowledge and
experience related to the potential of cable television and its implications
for libraries
3 to expand the participants understandings and perceptions of the
technology of cable television and its related equipment as they affect the
libraries communications responsibilities
4 to suggest some techniques for utilizing cable television in originating
local programs and to explore the possibilities for the varieties of
services cable television can offer the profession
5 to aid librarians in all types of libraries to become aware of the unique
possibilities for the utilization of cable television in their specific
types of libraries and also to suggest the importance of cable television
in a systematic approach to library and information networks and
6 to create a growing and continuing consciousness of the problems and
opportunities for the utilization of cable television in libraries

this is the final report of the colorado academic
libraries book processing center calbpc
project the calbpc project was begun in 1965
by nine academic libraries in colorado in an effort
to establish a centralized acquisition and processing
center the report of phase iii completed
in june 1968 dealt primarily with a general feasibility
study the design of the central system costs
of acquiring and processing in nine libraries and a
number of related concerns such as accounting the
congruence of approval plans and user attitudes toward
library services
this report focuses on the experimental operations
which were concluded officially on september 30
1969 whereas the phase iii study dealt with the
theory and principles upon which a system might
be based we are presently concerned with the
pragmatics of book processing the obstacles
encountered and the solutions achieved
although this report deals primarily with
cooperative acquisitions and processing we believe
it also contributes to a better understanding of
cooperative programs the experiment was designed
to monitor operations throughout the acquisition
cataloging cycle performance and cost measurements
were made on most internal and external aspects
of the system monitoring also extended into
the participating libraries where a product
acceptance study was conducted a secondary
objective of the project was to observe the
relationships which formed between the participants
and the central agency such as the interface of
systems and the human interaction of participants

the role of classification schemes in libraries and information services
has probably caused more argument than any other professional activity
this would be surprising if classification were no more than a fairly
convenient way of arranging books on shelves some librarians think it is
and support their view by heaping scorn on the heads of those who like the
classification research group actually spend years of their time in
theoretical discussions that seem to result in more and more abstruse and
difficult complications to what ought to be a straightforward exercise
yet today we can see clearly two relatively new spectacles on the library
scene on the one hand some librarians are criticizing the decimal
classification especially as used in the british national bibliography
for being too detailed and unwieldy on the other hand some librarians
and still more information officers are busy revising the universal
decimal classification in order to make it more detailed in the next
field as it were computerized indexing and retrieval systems are pounding
away at the evergrowing masses of literature producing results that
impress computer specialists but not information users who are so
deafened by the noise that they cannot hear what is new

the first problem that of learning of a publications existence is
tackled by a multiplicity of abstracting and indexing journals and
other bibliographies and at local levels by library catalogues and
unnecessary overlapping among these services while ensuring
adequately comprehensive coverage are very great but even if
these were overcome problems of the internal arrangement of these
bibliographical aids would still remain it is not enough for them
collectively to record every scientific publication the user must be
able to find every such record starting only with a subject on which
he wants information

the preface to the first edition of this book  which is reproduced
following this  shows that in 1958 the classification ideas in it
were felt to be controversial needing to be championed a few
years before the classification research group had issued a
memorandum proclaiming the need for a faceted classification
as the basis of all methods of information retrieval as partauthor
of this memorandum i must now judge the claim to have been
too bold even brash but it has been vindicated to an extent
for both in theory and practice the value of facet analysis in
the organization of subject vocabularies for indexing and search
has been widely accepted  whether these vocabularies are classified
or alphabetical and whether used in pre or postcoordinate fashion

basically threefold
1 to gather a reasonable collection of statistics relating to the general
practice of classification in this country
2 to gather information on th actual use of the dewey decimal
classification in this country
3 to provide a basis for the recommendations which are provided
periodically for the dewey editorial policy committee from the
library association library research committees subcommittee on
dewey decimal classification revision
to this end a questionnaire was sent out to over 1100 libraries of all types
throughout the country and after six months reminders sent to librarians
to ensure they had received them and that none had been overlooked the
result of this was very pleasing 716 were returned the vast majority
completed correctly the actual figures of type and size of library are
given in the body of the report but no type of library is completely omitted

an examination made over a period of years of the principles of
classifying law books for use in libraries and of their treatment in
many general and specialized classification schemes convinced me that
no scheme existed which was generally suitable for libraries in english
speaking countries outside the united states law collections in
academic libraries in the united kingdom and the commonwealth were
in a particularly difficult position they had the choice of adopting one
of the good american schemes which generally make inadequate
provision for the needs of overseas commonwealth libraries or of
adopting one of the english schemes each of which is virtually tailored
to a particular library and several of which are even less well suited
to overseas libraries or of devising new schemes for themselves there
seemed to be an urgent need for a practical law classification scheme
capable of being used in a variety of libraries large and small general
and special academic and professional in these countries

the plan of the following classification and index was developed early in
1873 it was the result of several months study of library economy as found
in some hundreds of books and pamphlets and in over fifty personal visits to
various american libraries in this study the author became convinced that
the usefulness of these libraries might be greatly increased without additional
expenditure three years practical use of the system here explained leads him
to believe that it will accomplish this result for with its aid the
catalogues shelf lists indexes and crossreferences essential to this
increased usefulness can be made more economically than by any other method
which he has been able to find the system was devised for cataloguing and
indexing purposes but it was found on trial to be equally valuable for
numbering and arranging books and pamphlets on the shelves

the author the dictionary and the classified catalogues
represent three successive stages in the order of evolution
of the internal form of the library catalogue the classified
form being the latest to evolve the literature relating
to it is comparatively scanty it is strikingly so in the
form of a systematic code of rules for cataloguing while
the number of codes for the author catalogue is fairly
large and the number for the dictionary catalogue is also
respectable there appear to be few systematic and complete
codes published in bookform for the classified catalogue
hence this little venture which is based on twentyfive
years of experimentation and on the valuable reciprocal
influence gained by its being taught to students of library
science during the last twenty years
while the call numbers occurring in the examples given
are constructed by the colon classification the rules of
this code are not necessarily dependent on that scheme for
their applicability they are all of general application
irrespective of the scheme of classification in use

the destructive effects of air pollution in the modern city upon
the health of its people its trees and its gardens even its buildings

against but the public generally and even many librarians

of the rapid deterioration of the worlds libraries under these
conditions in libraries museums and private homes preventive care
is regularly given to pictures and sculpture fine furniture silver
and brass but the gradually deteriorating volumes on the shelves are
given no more attention than an occasional dusting which abrades
the books more than it protects them i would judge that more than
90 percent of the books and documents that come to my bindery
for repair or restoration are in a condition that could have been
avoided by regular and appropriate preventive care unfortunately

the authors challenge accepted doctrine which asserts that the adequacy of
an academic library cannot be measured by the number of books which it
contains out of their feeling that the standards for college libraries and
the standards for junior college libraries are inadequate for estimating the
size in volumes required for minimum adequacy by libraries of institutions of
higher education of widely differing characteristics they developed new
formulas for this purpose these formulas attempt to identify the principal
factors affecting academic needs for books and to ascribe suitable to each
factor the authors then illustrate the application of the formulas to
specific institutions and conclude that while the results are useful further

example to the inadequate treatment of librarians within the university
community as a whole but little discussion has thus far appeared in print
concerning their treatment within the library itself this paper will attempt
to define certain progressive changes that it is possible and probably
desirable for the library to implement internally regardless of the universitys
willingness to consider improving the librarians lot in the larger community

recent emphasis placed on the use of microfiche by large government agencies
has increased the pressure in libraries supporting government research to make
greater use of microfiche negative and apathetic user attitudes expressed by
researchers indicate that expanded efforts to overcome resistance if the great
potential of microfiche is to be realized efforts in microphotography
expended on technical achievement in the past should be directed toward
understanding the user and his needs to discover why he avoids microforms and
how to overcome his resistance to them

the traditional overthecounter circulation count is not always considered
a reliable indicator of total library use to test this assumption the author
hypothesized that no correlation exists between the subjects of books taken out
of the library and those used within the library counts were made of books
left on tables chairs desks and other surfaces and correlated to books
charged out two studies were made in the first books were counted within
finely delineated lc and dewey class spans relating to academic departments
in the second books were counted within the broad lc first and second letters
and the dewey tens in the first case the overall correlation was 86 in the
second with less data 84 the author concludes that outoflibrary
circulation totals can be reliable indicators of inlibrary use for predicting
inlibrary use and thus total use two methods are citedsimple ratio of out

institutions in which changes in service policies and programs originated from
internal sources only in order to shift to an orientation that seeks to
develop new and expanding service programs the establishment to research
groups could do much to improve both the services offered by a library and its
role in the academic community while certain constraints always limit
modification or the initiation of services a properly constituted research

the criticism and transformation of society can be divorced only
at our peril from the criticism and transformation of theories about
society yet the gap between theory and practice so common in the
history of american radical movements is in some quarters growing
wider some of the most militant of american radicals in the
new left or in the movement for black liberation have at least
temporarily avoided any serious concern with social theory
this neglect of theory doubtless has various origins in some
part it is due to the fact that these social movements are still new
and their political activism consumes their necessarily limited
energies and resources the new radicalisms will in short need time
to produce their new theories although the neglect of theory is
scarcely peculiar to americans it is in part also due to the fact
that american radicals are often more american than they know and
may prefer the tangible outcomes of pragmatic politics to the
intangible outputs of theory again part of their neglect of theoretical
problems is probably due to the close links that some young radicals
have with the hippie contingent of their generation whose more
expressive and aesthetic styles of rejecting american culture
dispose them to avoid what they take to be the sterile hassles of
intellectual confrontation there is also a vocal minority who as
has been said feel personally excluded when they hear an appeal to
reason

a fully automatic document retrieval system operating on the ibm 7094 is
described the system is characterized by the fact that several hundred
different methods are available to analyze documents and search requests
this feature is used in the retrieval process by leaving the exact sequence of
operations initially unspecified and adapting the search strategy to the needs
of individual users
the system is used not only to simulate an actual operating environment but
also to test the effectiveness of the various available processing methods
results obtained so far seem to indicate that some combination of analysis
procedures can in general be relied upon to retrieve the wanted information
a typical search request is used as an example in the present report to
illustrate systems operations and evaluation procedures

service which supplies such information is not a satisfactory solution
activities of users at terminals and most application programs should remain
unaffected when the internal representation of data is changed
and even when some aspects of the external representation are changed changes
in data representation will often be nedded as a result of changes in query

since 1966 the johns hopkins university center for research in scientific
communication has been conducting studies of the information flow process 
the production dissemination and assimilation of information  associated with
nine scientific and engineering disciplines this process in most disciplines
appears from the dissemination point of view to consume about five years 
from the time a scientist begins his research until reports of his findings are
cited in a review to date we have conducted over sixty studies of this process
and since one of the main goals of our program is to make genuine comparisons
of the scientific communication associated with the disciplines being studied
we have standardized the procedures instruments and analyses in those of the
major studies which were conducted for all disciplines
we will present findings from the major studies conducted to date in order
1 to indicate the types of data we have collected on approximately 30000
scientists and engineers during the past three years 2 to indicate some of
the goals of our program and 3 to suggest a preliminary picture of the
communication structure of science as our program has led us to perceive it

in the course of collecting data on nine scientific and technological
disciplines it has become obvious to us that in their communication
activities some disciplines behave quite differently from others recently
we have reanalyzed our data for the physical the engineering and the social
sciences we do not have time to discuss differences among all three groups
so we have decided to compare only the physical and social sciences we have
included data pertaining to the engineering sciences on the graphs however
so you can get some idea of how they differ from the other two groups
before discussing these differences we should like to emphasize that there
are similarities that there are of major importance and that they in fact
make genuine comparisons among the groups feasible
we will discuss differences between the physical and the social sciences in
terms of three major communication characteristics associated with science

perhaps the fundamental problem of those that work in the scientific
information industry is that it is not just that special part of an information
industry that happens to deal with material having a scientific content
technical librarianship involves much more than librarianship applied to
books with an esoteric vocabulary and much mathematics
my reason for choosing this problem as a contribution for such a strategic
conference is that i know well as an historian of science that the greatest and
most useful advances in our technologies have not come from the applied
research of trained people trying to make themselves useful to society but
rather from basic research aimed at furthering understanding and curiousity
and powered by the latest instrumentation that the useful people have devised
i suspect that all the new indexing tools and computer handlings will be more
useful to basic research in understanding scientists than they will to
solving practical problems for which they are designed it seems clear
however that it is only such new understanding that can bring success
whatever solutions ultimately emerge

least minimally effective techniques have been devised for answering questions
from natural language subsets in small scale experimental systems and that a
useful paradigm has evolved to guide research efforts in the field current
approaches to semantic analysis and logical inference are seen to be effective
beginnings but of questionable generality with respect either to subtle aspects
of meaning or to applications over large subset of english generalizing from
current smallscale experiments to language processing systems based on
dictionaries with thousands of entries  with correspondingly large grammars
and semantic systems  may entail a new order of complexity and require the
invention and development of entirely different approaches to semantic analysis

in this note we attempt to point out why boolean functions
are in general not applicable in information retrieval
systems
first we wish to stress that a system which supposedly
is to serve a certain purpose has to try to optimize some
overall performance rather than certain detailed parts of
it this situation is of course well known
saying that a system should cater to an optimal performance
implies that the reward varies with different circumstances
that is there may always be some customers who will not agree
that the systems output is satisfactory however these
should be relatively few in the case of an information
retrieval system let us consider one whose function is to
furnish a reference list as a reaction to a question
so if we have a set of documents s and a set of questions
q the system has to assign to each question q an answer aq
which is a subset of s naturally this answer cannot be
chosen arbitrarily it should reflect a relation between
the question and the resulting reference list usually
one says that the documents in the list are relevant to
the question more precisely stated we assume that the
enquirer expects a certain reference list namely the one
he would have procured had he himself probed the documents
in the set

the teachable language comprehender tlc is a program
designed to be capable of being taught to comprehend
english text when text which the program has not seen before
is input to it it comprehends that text by correctly relating
each explicit or implicit assertion of the new text to a large
memory this memory is a semantic network representing
factual assertions about the world
the program also creates copies of the parts of its memory
which have been found to relate to the new text adapting
and combining these copies to represent the meaning of the
new text by this means the meaning of all text the program
successfully comprehends is encoded into the same format as
that of the memory in this form it can be added into the
memory
both factual assertions for the memory and the capabilities
for correctly relating text to the memorys prior content are to
be taught to the program as they are needed tlc presently
contains a relatively small number of examples of such
assertions and capabilities but within the system notations for
expressing either of these are provided thus the program
now corresponds to a general process for comprehending
language and it provides a methodology for adding the
additional information this process requires to actually
comprehend text of any particular kind
the memory structure and comprehension process of tlc
allow new factual assertions and capabilities for relating
text to such stored assertions and capabilities for relating
text to such stored assertions to generalize automatically
that is once such an assertion or capability is put into the
system it becomes available to help comprehend a great many
other sentences in the future

using direct access computer files of bibliographic
information an attempt is made to overcome one of the
problems often associated with information retrieval
namely the maintenance and use of large dictionaries
the greater part of which is used only infrequently
a novel method is presented which maps they hyperbolic
frequency distribution of text characteristics onto a
rectangular distribution this is more suited to
implementation on storage devices
this method treats text as a string of characters
rather than words bounded by spaces and chooses subsets
of strings such that their frequencies of occurrence are
more even than those of word types the members of this
subset are then used as index keys for retrieval the
rectangular distribution of key frequencies results in a much
simplified file organization and promises considerable
cost advantages

with when computers are used of course if cost is not an

farreaching changes in the patterns of communication in science
are at present in motion which seem likely to have fundamental
effects on scientistss use of and access to existing knowledge
these changes derive from the increasing involvement of computer
techniques in the publication dissemination and retrieval of scientific
and technical information many of the implications of the changes
are not yet clear informationhandling is rapidly changing from a
labourintensive industry to a capitalintensive one as soaring
manpower requirements reflect the increasing flow of information and
increasing demands for timeliness accuracy and improved access
but the changes to be effected also have major social implications
the reasons for publication and use of information are complex
reflecting the factors of a sociological nature which are still
imperfectly understood the rate at which innovations in information
handling win acceptance from scientists is determined partly by their
appreciation of the greater flexibility which the novel methods offer
but also by the sensitivity on the part of the designers and operators
of information systems to the needs and habits of users and to their
perception of the usefulness of the newer methods

objects are obtained using a similarity matrix by a simple iterative scan of
the universe of objects distributing them in such a way that an appropriate
cohesion function is minimized this actual clumpfinding process is embedded
in a overall package in which the information given by a classification is

the words of natural language texts exhibit a poisson or zipfian rank
frequency relationship ie a small number of common words accounts for a
large proportion of word occurrences while a large number of the words occur
as singletons or only infrequently invertedfile retrieval systems using free
text data bases commonly identify words as the keys or index terms about which
the file is inverted and through which access is provided they therefore
involve large and growing dictionaries and many entail inefficient utilization
of storage because of the distribution characteristics
an alternative approach may be based on the analysis of text in terms of
sets of variablelength character strings the frequency distributions of
which are much less disparate than those of words this could lead to
substantial reductions in dictionary size and increased efficiency both in
dictionary lookup times and storage utilization

the work published here is rather like those conclusive statements
of renaissance science that located the soul not in the human frame but
in the human spirit the author of this work may face the wrath of the
medievalists among our fellow professional catalogers at the least the
publication of this book should encourage a complete reappraisal of our
cataloging methods because the difference between title unit entry and
authorequivalent unit entry a confabulation of main and unit entry
arising from tradition rather than practicality can be clearly seen not
only in the job classifications and job descriptions of cataloging
departments but also in our philosophy of librarianship

librarians are known for their organizational work
with recorded knowledge information storage and retrieval
are two wellknown basic functions associated with this

that these functions have not been examined to any significant
degree from the users point of view this is true in regard
to library catalogs and library subject headings

as far as philosophers are concerned the conference seems to be justified
precisely because of the present state of the classification of knowledge for
two thousand years the classification of knowledge has been a major
philosophical problem lately it has evolved from a philosophical
preoccupation into a specialized technique a species of the general techniques
of classification far removed from philosophical preoccupations and equally
ignored by philosophers at the present time there exist powerful technical
models of classification and highly developed classifications of various
branches of knowledge what is lacking is a satisfactory general
classification of knowledge and an adequate clarification of the philosophical
problems underlying such classification the need for clarification is
important from the theoretical as well as practical point of view because
the general systems of classification of knowledge depend on theories of
knowledge it is therefore highly desirable that philosophers and specialists
in classification get together and discuss problems of common interest

this work describes a conceptual design of an automated
national library system the design is conceptual in that it is
intended to show the feasibility of a system concept rather than
provide a detailed engineering design the design concerns an
automated national library system but does not attempt to automate
all parts of the system it is primarily concerned with the functions of
bibliographic searching acquisition circulation and cataloging if
these functions can be economically automated the major problems
associated with our information explosion will be solved

this report and its recommendations are in response to the commissions
request for a nationwide program of continuing education for personnel in
the library and information science field while it is offered as only the
start of an ongoing process of developing a nationwide program its
recommendations are the result of an intensive ninemonth project involving
hundreds of persons in the library and information science fields
many of these persons participated in minicharettes in a written survey
or in personal interviews which addressed major issues such as certification
organizational and individual incentives for continuing education educational
methods and continuing education needs the contribution of these library
personnel cannot be overstated their collective wisdom and perspective
have led the project team to many of its major recommendations however
as would be expected when such a large number of people are involved
there were differences of opinion even as there are many differences of
opinion reflected in the literature of continuing education emanating from
the various professions in the present study most of these differences
related to the input into and control over the policies of the national
structure three alternative models which have been considered are outlined
in appendix d alternatives to several specific features of the recommended
model are presented at the end of chapter 4 throughout the text when issues
are presented on which there is uncertainty because of the intensity of
opinions expressed these areas are identified

this bibliography uses the traditional typology of libraries as its
starting point  public school academicresearch and special libraries
this classification is most commonly used and provides a sufficiently clear
distinction for the purposes of this work
public libraries are those which are free to all residents of the librarys
district and supported primarily from general public funds or taxes levied
for library purposes local public libraries systems of public libraries
and state library agencies are included in this category
school libraries are those maintained by the governing boards of
schools whether they be public private or parochial school libraries
at the elementary junior high school and senior high school level are
included
academicresearch libraries include the libraries of institutions of
higher education both public and private as well as libraries which
while they might be defined as either public or special are widely known
for their research resources junior college libraries college libraries
university libraries and technical school libraries are included as
academic libraries the library of congress the newberry library and
linda hall library are examples of nonacademic research libraries
special libraries are those directed toward making information available
to people within a particular organization with fairly welldefined
information needs business and industrial libraries and the libraries of
nonprofit organizations are common examples
while distinctions between research and special libraries are not
always easily made it is felt that in the case of this bibliography no
serious problems are created

the current need for a manual of copying methods dealing with the processes
methods techniques and types of equipment which can be used for reproducing
documents of a great many different kinds arises from two factors
1 the great importance of document reproduction processes in the
acquisition preservation dissemination and communication of information
vital to the conduct of research work in all fields of human endeavor and on an
international scale
2 the complexity of the field of document reproduction today which has
resulted from the enormous technical advances made in the past fifteen years
the need for the coining of the new class word  reprography an unfortunate
graft of a latin fragment on a greek root  is in itself indicative of the
great changes that have come about processes and methods which formerly were
discrete and distinctive have now become intricately interrelated new processes
and combinations of processes with different and astonishing capabilities
continue to appear this revolution in the document copying field has been
powerfully augmented by intensive competition on the part of manufacturers for
a share of the vast and lucrative officerecords copying field the results
however have led to highly important applications in the reproduction of
research materials as well

this study is an attempt to submit to a critical analysis the
main problems related to corporate headings the difficulties
raised by them and the solutions which now prevail in various
countries
in order to make the differences existing between the various
solutions and the unsatisfactory character revealed by many of
them more evident a great number of examples in a variety of
languages extracted from cataloguing codes national bibliographies
printed lists of corporate headings have been added these examples
are also intended to draw attention to differences existing with
regard to various technical details such as punctuation
capitalization transliteration etc
in addition many of these examples will clearly prove that
certain solutions which may be considered to be suitable for one
country or one language would not satisfy the requirements of
another country or another language
in the study examination and analysis of codes has been
complemented by references to professional literature on the subject
available to the author and by an analysis of opinions expressed
there special attention has been paid to comparisons of cataloguing
practices and citation usages and to investigations of the users
approach to corporate headings it is well understood and appreciated
that for the catalogue user the identification of and search for
corporate headings present more problems than any other type of
heading unfortunately however professional literature has as
yet paid insufficient attention to these problems

on almost all the occasions when we turn explicitly to the same problems
sir karls view of science and my own are very nearly identical we
are both concerned with the dynamic process by which scientific knowledge
is acquired rather than with the logical structure of the products of
scientific research given that concern both of us emphasize as legitimate
data the facts and also the spirit of actual scientific life and both of us
turn often to history to find them from this pool of shared data we draw
many of the same conclusions both of us reject the view that science
progresses by accretion both emphasize instead the revolutionary process by
which an older theory is rejected and replaced by an incompatible new one
and both deeply underscore the role played in this process by the older
theorys occasional failure to meet challenges posed by logic experiment
or observation finally sir karl and i are united in opposition to a number
of classical positivisms most characteristic theses we both emphasize for
example the intimate and inevitable entanglement of scientific observation
with scientific theory we are correspondingly sceptical of efforts to
produce any neutral observation language and we both insist that scientists
may properly aim to invent theories that explain observed phenomena and
that do so in terms of real objects whatever the latter phrase may mean

the ohio college library center is developing
a computerized useroriented library system
that will improve efficiency of library use and
operations that will increase availability of
library resources within a region and that will facilitate
evolution of new and easier accesses to information in
libraries the center does not conceive of its task as being
merely the mechanization of library procedures of the past
for the immediate future the principal academic objective
of the center is to increase the availability of library
resources for use in educational and research programs in
colleges and universities throughout ohio a more distant
objective is to enable libraries to participate actively in the
programs of instruction and research in their institutions
the passive service functions that libraries have developed
during the past century are proving inadequate to meet the
present demands made of libraries and will be increasingly
inadequate in the future
the perstudent costs of libraries are rising somewhat
more than twice as rapidly as unitcost rises in the general
economy therefore the principal economic goal of the
ohio college library center is to decelerate the rate of rise
of perstudent costs so that the rate of increase will
approximate that of the economy as a whole

these lectures do not present a descriptive theory of actual behavior
neither do they present a positive theory of behavior for a superintelligent
fictitious being nowhere in our analysis shall we refer to the behavior of an
idealized rational and economic man a man who always acts in a perfectly
consistent manner as if somehow there were embedded in his nature a coherent
set of evaluation patterns that cover any and all eventualities rather the
approach we take prescribes how an individual who is faced with a problem of
choice under uncertainty should go about choosing a course of action that is
consistent with his personal basic judgements and preferences he must
consciously police the consistency of his subjective inputs and calculate
their implications for action such an approach is designed to help us reason
and act a bit more systematically  when we choose to do so

design is used throughout in its most generic sense
to include planning operations research engineering design
architectural design programming budgeting and all the other
activities in which we consciously attempt to change ourselves and our
environment to improve the quality of our lives so the book could be
read as a philosophy of organization theory or of architectural or
engineering design or of operations research or of planning
the word inquiry suggests that the audience includes persons
interested in the philosophy of science this is true so long as the
interest is a very broad one concerned with the meaning of science with
respect to other social institutions health education morality and so
on inquiry is by no means restricted to the disciplines of science i
could have called the book the design of systems but this would not
adequately reflect my style which is to proceed from the more specific
problem of inquiry to the whole system

the deterioration of library materials constant since libraries began has
accelerated to alarming proportions in 1969 researchers have predicted that
all paperbased records of this century as well as those of earlier yearsface
imminent ruin without new and effective efforts for their preservation most
will not be usable in their present form in the next century the danger of
destruction threatens not only research library collections but also the world
of knowledge and scholarship that they support for not only paper is involved
similar dangers of destruction confront other cellulosic products such as
film which may substitute for paper as the material base of records and not
only research libraries are involved the surprisingly rapid deterioration of
printed materials even those that have been produced with some eye to
permanence creates problems and expenses for other libraries as well

this book presents the concept of the modern library as a comprehensive
resource center the philosophy and objectives of the center are clarified
and desirable practices in the selection and acquisition of nonbook or
audiovisual materials  interchangeably defined as those materials that
communicate primarily through aural and visual stimuli  are recommended
along with information pertinent to facilitating these tasks their
organization in general in discussed with emphasis on the necessity for
basic decisions and policies cataloging and physical processing are treated
in particular demonstrating that accepted library practices can be flexible
enough to allow adaptation for both the individual library and its specific
clientele realistic methods of handling the many different kinds of nonbook
materials are demonstrated by treating each type separately many easyto
follow cataloging examples are presented and consistent with established
library routine practical information is provided on selection acquisition
physical processing storage and equipment workflow charts are included
to present a graphic demonstration of efficient procedures

modern american library history has received only sporadic attention as a
subject for investigation though we have now accumulated an adequate supply
of source materials to draw upon in the form of annual reports service
studies biographical accounts and chronicles of individual libraries
no one has yet fashioned out of these materials a critical history of american
librarianship to paraphrase leo lamontagne we have salvaged remnants from
the past but we have yet to convert them into history
the lack has cost the profession dearly even a casual survey of the
literature of librarianship reveals the shocking degree of duplication and
naivete that stem from an insufficient awareness of previous efforts
there is clearly room and need for a series of evaluative studies of the
development of american library services which could eventually be put
together to form the desired definitive history of american librarianship
the present dissertation is intended as a contribution toward that end it
undertakes to furnish the historical background for one of the continuing
problems of american librarianship  the provision of reference services in
research libraries

the schedules of edition 18 like those of 17 are based on the
principle of subject integrity both the subject matter and the notation are
hierarchical so that what is true of a given whole is true of all its parts
the schedules are developed according to logical principles so that the
classifier is guided to make correct decisions the terminology of the
classification scheme reflects the terminology used by the literature
being classified
for ease of use this edition includes many more example notes more detailed
and precise instructions and freer use of laymans terminology than did its
immediate predecessor
since this edition is intended for use as a shelfarrangement system for
general libraries of all sizes its fulness is based upon the number of titles
that large libraries may be expected to acquire in various fields since
it is also intended for use in classified catalogs and bibliographies for
which the dewey decimal classification is increasingly in demand in many
countries it contains an increased number of provisions for number building

undergone a drastic transformation the enormity and depth of this
transformation can be measured in many ways it can be measured
in terms of the number of students enrolled in graduate and
undergraduate schools offering degrees in the physical and applied
sciences in terms of the number of new devices products and
innovations introduced into the military establishment and into the
civilian sector of our economy in terms of the number of scientists and
engineers employed by industry and public and private institutions
in terms of the amounts of money expended annually on research
and development in terms of the number of technical reports books
journals papers reprints and conference proceedings stemming
from these expenditures and in many other ways

this book is directed both to advanced college students
enrolled in sociology courses and to students of the other
social sciences such as anthropology economics history
and psychology who are concerned with diffusion for this
reason sociological concepts are defined when they are
introduced
more than five hundred publications on the diffusion of
innovations are reviewed here the innovations studied range
from new drugs among physicians to hand tools among primitive
tribes and from driver training among public high
schools to hybrid corn among farmers although a generally
consistent set of findings has emerged from these studies a
search of the literature shows little attempt to summarize and
evaluate available results and theories on the spread of ideas

as one of the early members of the computer community i have
been keenly interested in the development of quantitative methodologies
in the social and behavioral sciences and their encouragement
by the data processing environment the economists with an already
established mathematical orientation were among the earliest beneficiaries
of the machine technology that enhances their ability to
construct the test models of economic behavior today statistical
methods have so affected many disciplines that it is not unusual for
doctoral programs to accept statistical techniques as a substitute for
one foreign language similarly the ability to program in an
appropriate language is also frequently as acceptable as french or
german in providing the research skills needed by doctoral students at
the city university of new york and at other universities
the chief function of this directory in terms of academic supplies
of data is not to reinventory the social science data archives
that are wellknown to the academic community not to duplicate the
announcements of holdings that they themselves make available to their
members the reason for mentioning them and indicating the nature of
their holdings is to make this kind of data resource known to those
researchers either in or out of the university who are not sufficiently
aware of these important resources

the report is concerned with the social utility of libraries and
with the factors that appear to be requirements for effective
programs in the absence of established standards or criteria for
measuring program effectiveness we have substituted a comparative analysis of
a number of programs based on detailed observation of the program process
a survey of needs and interests of the
target groups both users and nonusers and an assessment of the
librarys role in the target neighborhood as it is perceived by other
community institutions serving the same groups thus a basis for
comparisons and for judgements has been introduced which provides
a foundation for suggestions as to the direction in which programs
of service to the disadvantaged might move
to achieve the study objectives library programs and practices
in lowincome neighborhoods were examined in a number of cities
in each of fifteen cities data were collected through interview and
observation in four subject areas 1 the needs and interests of
the community residents 2 library services in relation to other
available community resources 3 the nature and scope of the
neighborhood library program and its relation to the rest of the
library system and 4 available measures of the impact or
effectiveness of the program

more than half a century ago la fontaine and otlet started
their lives work which at first was connected with the term
bibliography but to which gradually the work documentation
was attributed what they developed was of a far wider scope
than the establishment of a new technique dealing with printed
and nonprinted documents
the great deal which inspired them and those who worked
side by side with them was to render accessible the totality of
what is crystallized from human thought and to make of it a
common treasure of mankind serving to bring mutual comprehension
and to build for peace by the cooperation of all men of goodwill
of all nations
it was in this spirit that my friend bradford joined those men
whose noble faces have passed and to whom it never was given to
see the achievement of the work to which they devoted their lives
and it was in this spirit that bradford thanks to his knowledge
and experience as scientist as well as librarian not only
gave his strong and valuable support to the common work but
added to it fundamental and constructive new elements
just for this reason the present book we owe to him gives far
more than a mere compilation of facts and experiences such
a compilation would indeed be welcome because curiously
enough up to now there is no good general treatise on
documentation available but his book gives us before all things
an abundance of original ideas and creative thoughts

this study addresses itself to several questions important to all public
libraries how should the library allocate its book budget what kinds of
books should it tend to buy what types of households use the library why
do some households not use the library what is the cost of the various
services provided by the library what specific steps can the library take
to improve its services what are the librarys options in choosing among the
different circulation systems for how long should the library allow books to
be checked out how frequently should overdue notices be sent out is an
investment in a security system worthwhile
we have studied these questions in the context of one public library  the
beverly hills california public library  and have developed a methodology
for determining answers to them as well as to other questions that arose
during our investigation although answers will vary from library to library
our methodology is quite general and should prove useful at many public
libraries

data on college and university libraries in the course
of our study we have examined the data for comprehensiveness
and consistency we have investigated their intertemporal
behavior both as a basis for projection and as an
instrument for longrange planning and we have constructed
a set of analytic interrelationships which permit us to derive
statistical estimates of the interrelations of some of the most
critical economic variables relating to library operations in
particular in the course of this last step we have provided
relationships explaining statistically the determination of
such variables as the size of libraries budgets and the
magnitude of their professional staffs

this report attempts to present and interpret current
winter 196869 information on the economics of book storage
in relation to the other factors a university administrator
must consider in developing a program for housing an
evergrowing book collection when there are present or
future limitations on space and money
the study will attempt to answer two specific questions
1 is it economical for colleges and universities to select
socalled littleused books from the regular bookstacks and
store them elsewhere 2 is the cost factor the only one a
university need consider in adopting a storage program and
if not how is cost related to the others
the facts and conclusions in this report are based on
the library book storage situation as of 1969 innovations
in computer applications and other technologies could
presumably change the nature of some of the cost factors but
it is the authors opinion that these changes unlikely to
occur within the next 5 to 10 years

it is not a simple matter to describe this book briefly it
attempts to provide and apply a set of concepts from economic theory
that may prove valuable to those who are now or may become decision
makers in the selection financing andor use of computers only
theory relevant for such decisionmakers is presented here this means
that the effects of computers on the economy as a whole lie outside
the scope of this book as do a number of related issues we deal
thus with microeconomic not macroeconomic theory our focus is on the
small industry firm computer and not the large gross national
product consumer price index unemployment

the purpose of this book is to explain a way of looking at military
problems which we and others with whom we have been associated have
found fruitful in insights and productive of solutions essentially we
regard all military problems as in one of their aspects economic
problems in the efficient allocation and use of resources we believe
that this way of looking at military problems goes far toward reconciling
the apparent conflict of views between the officers and officials who are
responsible for defense and the officials and congressmen whose primary
interest is economy  except in determining the overall size of the
military budget where conflict between these points of view is inevitable

the exponential growth of the literature of science and technology is a
phenomenon which scientists have been living with for the past 300 years
it is in the nature of such growth that its effect is recognized only slowly
but when a critical point is reached its consequences can be overwhelming
in science information this point has now been reached to take but one
field chemistry it took well over two centuries for the first million papers
to be published and over 30 years from 1907 to 1938 for the first million
to be abstracted in chemical abstracts we are now at the stage where one
million papers have been abstracted in a fiveyear period  19621967  and
before 1975 the point will have been reached where one million papers equal
to the output of the whole prewar generation of chemists will be
published and abstracted in a single year the first scientific serial began
publication in 1665 some 290 years later in 1956 the science museum
library was receiving 9000 current scientific serials within only a
further 11 years the national lending library for science and technology
nll was receiving over three times this number the growth in the use
of scientific literature is no less spectacular thus for example in 1930
the number of loans by the science museum library was 10000 in 1967 the
nll which had taken over the national lending function of the science
museum library lent well over halfamillion items a total exceeding that of
all the loans by the science museum library between 1929 and 1947 a period
which itself saw the discovery of nuclear fission and its application for
peaceful uses enormous progress in antibiotics developments in synthetic
materials and great advances in all branches of science and technology
there are some signs that the rate of increase implied in these examples
may not be maintained but any flatteningout that may develop will be at
a very high level indeed

librarians publishers and information system engineers have very
little verified information and few guidelines to describe the users specific
requirements for information such information is needed to properly
design or evaluate the information systems to date most of the statements
of requirements have been rather subjective and often reflect opinion
rather than actual fact relatively little objective data have been
obtained this is probably due in large part to the fact that there are
extremely difficult methodological problems in trying to determine and
state user requirements in a meaningful manner this paper suggests an
approach or point of view that might help this situation by providing a
method of phrasing the statements of user requirements in a more
convenient and meaningful manner this paper also furnishes several
examples of such statements and discusses the techniques and data that
support these statements
in this paper attention is initially focused on the information requirements
of workers in the field of science and technology with no serious
attempt made to include workers in other fields however it seems quite
likely that the approach and perhaps even the stated principles could be
extended and generalized to cover other fields of knowledge

citation indexing is a relatively new method of organizing the contents of a
collection of documents in a way that overcomes many of the shortcomings of the
more traditional indexing methods the primary advantage of citation indexing
is that it identifies relationships between documents that are often overlooked
in a subject index an important secondary advantage is that the compilation
of citation indexes is especially well suited to the use of manmachine indexing
methods that do not require indexers who are subject specialists furthermore
citations which are bibliographic descriptions of documents are not
vulnerable to scientific and technological obsolescence as are the terms used
in subject indexes

dialog is the name given to an interactive computerbased information
retrieval language developed at the lockheed palo alto research laboratory
the dialog systems consists of a series of computer programs which have been
designed to make full use of direct access memory devices in which data
located anywhere on the device can be accessed in approximately the same amount
of time and video display units to provide the user a rapid and powerful means
of identifying records within a file which satisfy the particular information
need by providing the user full display access to the indexing vocabulary
and the ability to modify search expressions dialog becomes a data processing
extension of the human operator who directs and controls the process according
to his own personal needs

an alternative hypothesis to
be investigated is that to a considerable extent the
references are scattered throughout all periodicals
with a frequency approximately related inversely
to the scope on this hypothesis the aggregate of
periodicals can be divided into classes according to
relevance of scope to the subject concerned but the
more remote classes will in the aggregate produce
as many references as the more related classes the
whole range of periodicals thus acts as a family of
successive generations of diminishing kinship each
generation being greater in number than the
preceding and each constituent of a generation
producing inversely according to its degree of
remoteness
the investigation covered in the first place the
references quoted in the course of four and two and
ahalf years respectively by the current bibliographies
of applied geophysics and lubrication which are
prepared in the library the source of each
reference being given it was possible to arrange the
sources in order of productivity the results being

several major developments have contributed to the rapid emergence
of the field of errorcorrecting codes over the past two decades
externally the cost of solidstate electronic devices has decreased almost as
dramatically as their size this has stimulated the development of digital
computers and peripheral devices and this in turn has caused a dramatic
increase in the volume of data communicated between such
machines the intolerance of computing systems to error and in some
cases the inherently critical nature of the data demand the use of either
errorfree facilities or some type of errordetecting or correcting code in
the terminal devices in many cases the latter approach is the more
economical

the continuing need to put scientists in contact with the research of
others coupled with the rapidly expanding volume of published
material during the past several decades has placed new emphasis on
the old arts of assembling coding and disseminating recorded
knowledge in some instances the emphasis has manifested itself in
research on improvement of traditional library systems in other
instances it has resulted in the assembly of specialized collections and
their intensive indexing for access in a variety of ways still other
systems have progressed from the passive role of responding to
requests to the active role of supplying documents or references to
them to researchers as the documents become available for lack of a
more descriptive terminology all of these activities are referred to in
this book as document transfer systems implying that the product
being retrieved or disseminated is a document rather than the
information if any in it that is intelligence systems or fact retrieval
systems if facts are indeed retrieved are excluded from our concern
the document of course may be a book a journal article a drawing
an abstract a piece of film or a piece of magnetic tape

micropublishing as it pertains to library materials is essentially
a form of the republishing of materials no longer in print the need
for such materials of many kinds  monographs serials newspapers
reference works  has grown greatly during the past quarter century and
this need is reflected in the growth of the micropublishing industry as
new colleges and junior colleges are founded and established colleges
and universities continue to expand to meet growing educational needs
both groups of institutions find that in more and more instances the
materials they need are available only in microform as a result the
ratio of microforms to books in college and research libraries has been
steadily rising

in these days of large government programs intended to reduce poverty
develop communities prevent delinquency and crime control disease and
reconstruct cities the predominant rhetoric is that of planning pilot
projects experimental and demonstration programs  and evaluation those
who seek to select for support the more promising plans and projects submitted
to funding agencies have become habituated to the ritualistic inclusion in
the proposal of a final section on evaluation in most cases this section
consists of sometimes grandiose but usually vague statements of intent and
procedure for assessing the impact of the proposed action in some cases
there is an elegant highly academic and impractical scheme worked out in
meticulous detail by an obviously talented research consultant in a few
treasured instances there is a wellconsidered realistic and workmanlike
plan for getting some fairly reliable answers to the questions of what worked

formal and informal scientific communication are complementary
they must not be thought of as alternatives in the sense that
perhaps certain messages are obtained exclusively through the printed
word the library and the mechanized searchandretrieval system
whereas others are obtained by the exclusive use of wordofmouth and
the telephone the much more typical event is one in which the receipt
of a single message is secured by the successive interplay of these two
kinds of communication for any given transaction between a scientist
as a receiver of information and the channel that brings him that
information usually has a history behind it and a future ahead of it that
may be very relevant to the evaluation of the success of that transaction
and to the prognosis of whether this kind of transaction will happen
again with similar results

the study is a result of a theory of librarianship which has been in the
process of maturation for more than a quarter century of teaching and
administration first at the university of chicago and subsequently at western
reserve university now case western reserve university and which has
been elaborated in essays and addresses as the inquiry progressed
my purpose has been to explore the role of the library as it contributes
to the total communication system in society and the meaning of that role
for the library profession and having determined the requirements of that
role to identify those which are appropriately met by graduate professional
education therefore the inquiry begins with a consideration of the
communication system within the individual as related to his physiological
neurological and psychological structure and its meaning for learning and
reading patterns and characteristics the study then progresses to an
exposition of the cultural environment and its communication system in society
together with the place of the library in it

the use of classification in libraries is traditional and its value is
appreciated for documentation and information retrieval in
general other techniques such as alphabetical indexing and
machine selection are also available that classification is of
value in information retrieval as well as in book arrangement is
however made evident in two ways first to achieve consistency
and subtlety in alphabetical indexing and machine selection
designers of such retrieval systems find the need to introduce
classificatory techniques second there is a continuing demand
for the construction of special classifications for detailed arrangement
and cataloguing of documents in restricted but intensively
cultivated fields of knowledge
it is to help meet these demands particularly the second that
this guide has been prepared the techniques of detailed depth
classification have been greatly developed during the past decade
and instruments of much greater subtlety and efficiency than the
traditional treeofknowledge schemes can now be designed
these developments have been reported mainly as research papers
in a variety of library journals and are often made unnecessarily
difficult to follow by the use of unfamiliar terminology
there is a need for a more simply written and more readily
available practical guide to the use of the newer techniques of
classification

the test results are presented for a number of different index languages
using various devices which affect recall or precision within the environment
of this test it is shown that the best performance was obtained with
the group of eight index languages which used single terms the group of
fifteen index languages which were based on concepts gave the worst performance
while a group of six index languages based on the thesaurus of
engineering terms of the engineers joint council were intermediary of
the single term index languages the only method of improving performance
was to group synonyms and word forms and any broader groupings of terms
depressed performance the use of precision devices such as links gave no
advantage as compared to the basic device of simple coordination

the strong correlation between the scope and depth of this countrys
research and development activities and the vigor and the growth of its
industrial plant is today a widely accepted fact government expenditures
for research and development have increased from a modest
annual rate of 200 million some thirty years ago to 17 billion today
the research budgets of the private sector of the economy which were
almost miniscule in the 1930s total approximately 8 billion today
these expenditures have had their many tangible and visible results
ranging from nylon and antibiotics to radar and solid state electronics
but what is not so generally appreciated is the additional product
represented by the increasing inventory of ideas and new knowledge
whose application for the most part is still a potential one the
sophisticated and often urgent nature of some of the larger products in
which we engage today which require vast research expenditures to
find the efficient way or the economical way or the safe way or the
most accurate way to accomplish some end purpose also produces an
increase in the national level of scientific and technological competence
that has not yet been transferred into the civilian economy the
value of the technical ideas now stored and awaiting application can
be estimated as a value many times larger than the annual rate of
billions of dollars invested in the effort it took to develop this increased
technical capability as a national resource for underwriting further
economic and industrial development this technical inventory is a
factor of major importance

libraries taking the first departure in 2300 years from that durable
model conceived by the librarians of alexandria and endlessly replicated
by every succeeding generation of librarians right down to the present

that to be good a library must be vast and always growing the papers

this book develops a theory of formal languages from the point of view of
generative devices mainly grammars recognition devices automata are
introduced only as a secondary tool and are themselves presented within the
framework of rewriting systems
the main emphasis is on mathematical aspects of formal languages rather
than application people interested only in applications to programming
languages resp natural languages would certainly prefer a more
comprehensive discussion on topics such as lrk grammars resp
transformational grammars such discussions lie outside the scope of
this book

this book presents the theory of formal languages as a coherent theory
and makes explicit its relationship to automata the book begins with an
explanation of the notion of a finite description of a language the
fundamental descriptive device  the grammar  is explained as well as
its three major subclasses  regular contextfree and contextsensitive
grammars the contextfree grammars are treated in detail and such topics
as normal forms derivation trees and ambiguity are covered four types of
automata equivalent to the four types of grammars are described these
automata are the finite automaton the pushdown automaton the linear
bounded automaton and the turing machine the turing machine is covered in
detail and unsolvability of the halting problem shown the book concludes
with certain advanced topics in language theory  closure properties
computational complexity deterministic pushdown automata lrk grammars
stack automata and decidability

destroying its function for the active researcher certain of
the advantages of formal communication such as general
accessibility permanence etc how can formal channels be
manipulated to take on the characteristics of informal
communication to cast light on these questions the present
paper examines the role of informal and formal channels within
the overall system of scientific dissemination in psychology
considers the special advantages of informal communication
and outlines certain relations between informal and formal
channels in a final section of the paper two experiments
in scientific communication are described one experiment being
built about an innovation that attempts to informalize formal
channels while the other is built about another innovation that
in general attempts to formalize an informal channel

the present book sums up a certain stage in the research on algebraic
linguistics being pursued at charles university prague it is based mainly
on p sgalls book 1967a in czech which represents the first attempt at a
systematic formulation of the conception of generative description that has
gradually been elaborated by our research group
we do not claim that any particular question has been answered here in a
definitive way but the conception of a generative system based on an
articulation of the semantic relation see section 134 may perhaps be
interesting in connection with the present development of algebraic linguistics
this conception originated in 19631964 mainly as a reaction to the existing
form of transformational description it has not yet been possible to take the
more recent impulses into account to an extent that would be adequate to their
scope and theoretical significance only some aspects of these impulses are
commented on in the relevant parts of the present book we do not present a
complete characterization of a system that could be regarded as a counterpart
to the new version of transformational grammar we have simply tried
to formulate a conception that can serve as a starting point for the
development of a new alternative

the last decade has brought new inventions of enormous potential
it will probably be two decades before we fully grasp the shattering effect
they will have on society
these inventions include
the communication satellite suddenly this has provided telephone
and television links to the underdeveloped world much larger satellites
will be built and will have an enormous impact on education and
communications both in the united states and throughout the world the
satellite antennae in some underdeveloped countries stand next to fields
ploughed by oxen
the helical waveguide a pipe now operating that can carry 250000
simultaneous telephone calls or equivalent information over long distances
the laser this means of transmission still in the research laboratory
has the potential of carrying many millions of simultaneous telephone calls
or their equivalent
largescale integration lsi a form of ultraminiaturized computer
circuitry that probably marks the beginning of mass production of
computers and computerlike logic circuitry it offers the potential of
extremely reliable extremely small and in some of its forms extremely
fast computers if largeenough quantities can be built this circuitry can
become very low in cost
online realtime computers computers capable of responding to many
distant terminals on telecommunication lines at a speed geared to human
thinking they have the potential of bringing the power and information
of innumerable computers into every office and eventually every home
picturephone a public dialup telephone system in which subscribers
see as well as hear each other
large tv screens tv screens that can occupy a whole wall if necessary
cable tv provides a cable into homes with a potential signalcarrying
capacity more than one thousand times that of the telephone cable it
could be used for signals other than television
voice answerback computers can now assembly humanvoice words and
speak them over the telephone this fact coupled with the touchtone
telephone set makes every such telephone a potential computer terminal
millimeterwave radio radio at frequencies in the band above the
microwave band can relay a quantity of information greater than all the
other radio bands combined chains of closely spaced antennas will distribute
these millimeterwave signals
pulse code modulation all signals including telephone picturephone
music facsimile and television can be converted into digital bit stream
and transmitted along with computer data over the same digital links
major advantages accrue from this
computerized switching computerized telephone exchanges are coming into
operation and computerlike logic can be employed for switching and
concentrating all types of signals
data banks electronic storage for huge quantities of information that
can be manipulated and indexed by computers and that can be accessed in a

the fundamental principles of reference work remain
more or less constant through the years but the rapid
expansion of the publication of reference books in all
fields makes essential a careful selection to fit the needs
of each library the purpose of this volume is to list
reference books basic to research  general and special 
and thus to serve as 1 a reference manual for the
library assistant research worker or other user of
library resources 2 a selection aid for the librarian and
3 a textbook for the student who either in library
school training class or college course in bibliography
is pursuing a systematic study of reference books
the needs of these types of users have influenced the
organization and makeup of this volume in that the
requirements of the first two groups have made the
manual more comprehensive than it might have been if
intended for a textbook only while the introductions to
sections and many of the annotations have been provided
particularly for the library school student

corporation the project included a questionnaire survey of all federal
libraries 2104 as of december 1970 to gather systems planning data and
to identify federal libraries with operational or planned automated systems
respondents in the latter group were sent a federal library automation survey
questionnaire requesting specific details about existing and planned systems
from these sources amplified by visits to federal libraries and an extensive

librarianship and comparative method and is intended for both
teachers of comparative librarianship and their students it can be
approached in a number of ways the first three chapters outline
comparative librarianship and the theoretical basis of its
methodology against the wider background of other comparative sciences
and the scientific method the three chapters following are purely
practical and explain the various steps of writing a comparative
study the last chapter is intended for teachers
the second part compiled by mrs mackee is a bibliographical
guide to the main sources on librarianship throughout the world
it draws on the bibliographies collected by comparative librarianship
students in the course of their project work on replies to a
questionnaire sent to the various library associations of the world
and on mrs mackees own collection of references gathered over a

the purpose of this book therefore is to assist libraries and librarians in
resolving some of the problems faced in utilizing this new technology the
intent is to provide a concrete factual guide to the principles and methods
available for the application of modern data processing to library operations
for the operating librarian it should be considered a handbook a tool to
guide him in decisions concerning the introduction of data processing techniques
into his own library for the student it should be a textbook educating him
not only in methodology but also in the interrelationships between data
processing and the library for the system designer it should be a summary
of the stateoftheart serving as a bridge between library objectives and
the technology the book throughout lays special stress on the library and
particularly on the significance of library values and policies for determining
the choice of system the book gives emphasis to the computer but always in
the context of applying this technology to the solution of operating problems
as an addition to resources for information service as a tool of good
management and not as an end in itself at most therefore the book aims to
educate the profession in the use of these tools and in the special problems
of applying them to libraries in this respect much of the groundwork has
already been done  the profession has been educating itself has carried out
analyses of library operations has experimented with mechanization and is
developing better concepts of cost control the book merely continues a
process that is already underway

the four years since the first edition of this book was published have been a
period of exceptional advance in the usage of computers in libraries where
one or two examples were all that were available at that time to illustrate
each kind of application now there are five to ten where the cadre of
knowledgeable people in libraries at that time was small now virtually
every major library has some kind of systems department where the efforts at
that time were largely experimental and developmental now there is a wealth
this second edition has therefore been written in a context totally different
from that of the first
but its aims are the same to ensure that practicing librarians and that
students in library schools approach the world of automation with knowledge
of its capabilities and limitations and with the techniques of systems
analysis by which to analyze and evaluate alternative answers to the librarys
processing problems the changes from the first edition therefore represent
not a departure from that purpose but simply an updating of its content to
reflect the advances and experience gained and an opportunity to correct
the errors hopefully minor that have been found through use of the first
edition

the medical library association has long been aware of the need for a
third edition of the handbook changes in library practices proliferating
demands upon established libraries and the development of new ones
created the need of an uptodate tool like the earlier editions
this handbook is such a tool a manual not a survey of the state of the
art it offers practical advice to all  fledgling librarians starting
their careers experienced librarians transferring to the field of
health sciences established medical librarians refreshing memories or
adopting procedures unfamiliar to them and specialists in related fields

generally speaking there are two types of books of interest to the
serious reader today those that are content oriented designed to
convey a particular body of knowledge and those that deal with structure
the way in which events are organized it is doubtful if an author
has any control over which of these two types of books he writes
though it is desirable that he be aware of the difference the same
applies to the reader whose satisfaction depends largely on his
unstated expectations in todays world when all of us are overwhelmed
with data from many sources it is easy to understand why people
are apt to feel that they are losing touch with developments even in
their own field one senses that there is also a growing awareness
of a loss of relatedness to the world at large this loss of relatedness
leads to an increased need for organizing frames of reference to aid
in intergrating the mass of rapidly changing information with which man
must cope the hidden dimension attempts to provide just this

someone has observed that the roots of the present lie deep in the
past and must be uncovered to understand fully how the present came to
be what it is this study is less a descriptive history of library schools
and their work than a search for perspective within which major problems
as well as the course pursued in resolving them can be more fully
understood the original study begun in 194142 sought to throw light
on how library education at that time came to be what is was the

nearly twentyfive years ago it occurred to me that we might gain
considerable insight into the mainsprings of human behavior if we viewed it
purely as a natural phenomenon like everything else in the universe and if
we studied it with the same dispassionate objectivity with which one is wont
to study say the social behavior of bees or the nestbuilding habits of
birds the present book reports the results of the extended inquiry that
ensued in the course of those years and which led to the disclosure of
some fundamental principles that seem to govern important aspects of our
behavior both as individuals and as members of social groups

this volume is an attempt to substantiate the thesis that the
human side of enterprise is all of a piece  that the theoretical
assumptions management holds about controlling its human resources
determine the whole character of the enterprise they determine
also the quality of its successive generations of management
of course the process is circular and herein lies the possibility
and the hope of future progress the key question for top management
is what are your assumptions implicit as well as explicit about
the most effective way to manage people from the answer to this
question flow the answers to the questions mr sloan raised in our
discussion about the making of managers as well as answers to many
other questions which perplex and confound management as it seeks to
achieve more successfully the economic objectives of enterprise it
will be clear to the reader that i believe many of our present assumptions
about the most effective way to manage people are far from adequate

written communication of ideas is carried out on the basis of statistical
probability in that a writer chooses that level of subject specificity and that
combination of words which he feels will convey the most meaning since this
process varies among individuals and since similar ideas are therefore relayed
of different levels of specificity and by means of different words the problem
of literature searching by machines still present major difficulties a
statistical approach to this problem will be outlined and the various steps
of a system based on this approach will be described steps include the
statistical analysis of a collection of document in a field of interest the
establishment of a set of notions and the vocabulary by which they are
expressed the compilation of a thesaurustype dictionary and index the
automatic encoding of documents by machine with the aid of such a dictionary
the encoding of topological notations such as branches structures the
recording of the coded information the establishment of a searching pattern

the problem of organizing a large mass of data occurs frequently in
research normally some process of generalization is used to compress the
data so that it can be analyzed more easily a primitive step in this process
is the clustering technique which involves gathering together similar data
into a cluster to permit a significant generalization
this paper describes a number of methods which make use of ibm 7090 computer
programs to do clustering a medical research problem is used to illustrate

the analytical problems of developing quantitative techniques for r  d
investment management are often complicated by the existence of conflicting
goals corporate goals may require the r  d manager to simultaneously seek
the highest probable profits the largest probable number of successes and the
greatest probable profit per dollar spent departmental goals may restrict the
manager to some maximum budget a minimum number of projects to be worked on
and minimum levels of accomplishment on specific projects in a sense then
the research manager is faced with a constrained multipleoutput production
problem how much to spend on which project and how much to spend overall
this paper shows how a slight modification of hess approach to project
selection and an analogy to the theoretical economics of a multipleproduct
factory have been used to help our research management simultaneously solve
these project selection resource allocation and budget determination
problems most approaches in the literature have treated these three problems

factors influencing idea generation behavior in industrial rd laboratories
the model is constructed from literaturebased propositions which make
explicit the role played by several organizational factors identified in the
model data were collected on about 300 ideas created in a divisional
laboratory of a major us corporation in general these data support the
a priori propositions further data analysis suggests that two pieces of
information are required before an idea is generated 1 knowledge of a need
problem or opportunity relevant to the company and 2 knowledge of a means or
technique for satisfying the need solving the problem or capitalizing on the
opportunity these results are discussed with respect to the stage of creative
thought proposed by other investigators finally the organizational events

models and techniques to aid management in planning
controlling rd projects frequently use subjective probability of
success forecasts as one of the major inputs an experiment was
conducted at the research laboratories of monsanto company to
measure the predictive validity and consistency of such forecasts
the results indicate that the eventual success or failure of certain
types of rd projects can be predicted by measuring the time shape
of polled probability of success forecasts probability of success
forecasts appear to yield more valid advance warning indicators than
several commonly used project status measures these results tend
to support the hypothesis that rd planning and control models that
are based on subjective probability estimates may reliably be used
by management to aid in early identification of eventually failing

between onethird and onehalf of indexable terms are not retrievable from
article titles even if all possible synonyms and related terms are used if
all synonyms are used instead of one keyword the amount of information
retrieved is increased by about 70 percent the problems of dealing with

the motivation for this investigation derived from a
series of visits to institutions which were deeply committed
to the design development and operation of nontraditional
automated information systems at the time of the visits
the systems seemed to be working technically but paradoxically
they did not appear to have made a significant impact on the
respective user communities although few people associated
with the systems openly expressed concern there were nonverbal
indicators which suggested that some people were becoming nervous
since all of the systems represented high expenditures of time
and money a feeling of uneasiness seemed quite appropriate

particular hindrances but the three bodies which have sponsored this report

and some findings of over seventy studies which we conducted from 1966 to 1971
on the informationexchange activities of over 12000 scientists and engineers
in a sample of nine physical social and engineering sciences we designed the
studies so that a the full spectrum of scientific communication media could
be explored b the various studies were coupled in order that data obtained
from one study could be directly related to those obtained from other studies
c the scheduling of the studies was conducted in real time in order that the
same body of information could be followed from its inception to its final
integration into the general body of scientific knowledge and d the same
studies were conducted for all nine disciplines being studied in order that
genuine comparisons could be made among them the data are now stored on
machinereadable magnetic tapes and will be made available to scholars in the

we apply a 200yearold mathematical theorem to a 175yearold historical
problem more to advance statistics than history though problems of disputed
authorship are common in history literature and politics scholars regard their
solutions as minor advances for us the question of whether hamilton or
madison wrote the disputed federalist papers has served as a laboratory and
demonstration problem for developing and comparing statistical methods
while we help solve this historical problem our practical application of bayes
theorem to a large analysis of data is a step in testing the feasibility of a
method being explored with fresh attitudes and fresh mathematics furthermore
large practical applications have until now been few and our work helps fill
that gap

analysis is made of the effect of using an efficient code of compression of
terms within a document data base the storage efficiency is expressed in
terms of the vocabulary length and the values of certain parameters which
describe the structure of the code for vocabularies of up to 100000 terms
the average code length is approximately twelve bits no information is lost
through term truncation or abbreviation the tables required for coding and
decoding may be ordered for rapid access without reduction in the ease of

the point of departure in this paper is the definition of a language l as
a fuzzy relation from a set of terms t  x to a universe of discourse
u  y as a fuzzy relation l is characterized by its membership function
mltu  01 which associates with each ordered pair xy its grade of
membership mlxy in l
given a particular x in t the membership function mlxy defines a fuzzy
set mx in u whose membership function is given by mmxy  mlxy
the fuzzy set mx is defined to be the meaning of the term x with x playing
the role of a name for mx
if a term x in t is a concatenation of other terms in t that is
x  x1  xn xi t i epsilon 1n then the meaning of x can be expressed in
terms of the meanings of x1xn through the use of a lambdaexpression or by
solving a system of equations in the membership functions of the xi which are
deduced from the syntax tree of x the use of this approach is illustrated by
examples

the concept of relevance sometimes also called pertinence or
aboutness is central to the theory of information retrieval unfortunately
however there is at present no consensus as to how this notion should be
defined the purpose of this paper is to propose and defend a definition of
what it means to say that a piece of stored information is relevant to the
information need of a retrieval system user
the suggested definition explicates relevance in terms of logical
implication for one yesorno question answering system which operates with
one of the standard formalized languages the definition provides a
mathematically precise criterion of relevance for other types of fact
retrieval systems and reference retrieval systems including all systems whose
stored information is expressed in natural language the definition is not
mathematically precise but is nevertheless still helpful on a conceptual
level

the paper describes a technique which enables an on line computer based
information retrieval system to aid the indexers by selecting possible index
terms to be assigned to a new document entering the system
the method analyses the index terms assigned to the references cited by the
new article this produces a list of index terms weighted according to their
expected correlation with the subject matter of the new article thus the
indexer is presented with the weighted list of proposed indexing terms as an
aid
an evaluation is made of the results produced by the technique for a trial
set of documents these documents have already been indexed for the medlars
system the list of actual index terms for this trial set of documents is
compared with the set of index terms proposed by the technique for each
document the results of this comparison are encouraging and they are
discussed in the paper
the economic aspects of implementing the technique in a working information
retrieval system is considered this included the expected benefits and an
estimate of the cost of using the technique as an aid in terms of computer
time and indexer time

beyond the usual slapdash use of the words relevant and relevance and
have attempted to explicate the concept further both attempts only partially
succeed konigova proposes three types formal relevance subjectcontent
relevance and subjective relevance or pertinency this classification has
validity but is not further elaborated and indeed she reverts to a less
precise language for example in defining second order noise she uses the
ambiguous phrase a formally relevant document which is not really relevant 
presumably meaning not subjectively relevant according to the real need of
the enquirer and in her mathematics as she admits no account is taken of
the subjective relevance pertinence yet this is surely the true aim of the
system

an evaluation of graph theoretical clusters of index terms which can be
extracted from an automatically indexed document collection and the effects of
employing such cluster in automatic document retrieval is described the graph
theoretical cluster which were developed from six data base under two different
cluster definition were analyzed for average size and related data the
clusters were also used to expand the queries in each of six data bases to
determine the effect of the expansions on the document retrieval results
although a large variety of clusters and associated query explanations were
obtained no significant improvements in the document retrieval performance
were achieved in some cases however significant degradations in the
retrieval performance occurred although seemingly meaningful clusters can be
obtained the results indicate that the effort involved in finding clusters
and adding the clustered terms to queries is far to great to warrant their use
in an operational system the data bases employed were relatively small and
the authors caution against generalizing these results to large data bases or
other situations

the concept of situational relevance is introduced based on wscoopers
definitions of logical relevance on the notion of evidential relevance drawn
from inductive logic on the notions of a personal stock of knowledge and a set
of personal concerns the latter explained in terms of preferences over ranges
of alternatives situationally relevant items of information are those that
answer or logically help to answer questions of concern significant
situationally relevant information is explained in terms of changes of view in
relation to questions of concern it is claimed that situational relevance is
an explication of the ordinary notion of practical relevance and that it is
the appropriate relevance concept to use in evaluation of systems supplying
practically relevant information

the design of programs to research large document data bases is discussed
with regard to the use of compression coding combined with adoption of word
fragments as the basic language elements an algorithm is described for
determination of a set of almost equifrequent fragments its efficiency is
tested for a sample data base formed from the marc tapes a certain threshold
frequency acts as a parameter whose value determines the number of distinct
fragments the selection algorithm is designed to give some preference to
choice of the longest fragments and hence allow compact coding of the data base
by concatenation of nonoverlapping fragments

mechanized information retrieval  to teach basics to those who have had no
previous exposure either to the field or to computers or both therefore
the action is slowed to the point where the logical principles of information
retrieval systems are laid bare other books have been published that emphasize
computer programming  this one does not

a fuzzy set is a class of objects with a continuum of grades of membership
such a set is characterized by a membership characteristic function which
assigns to each object a grade of membership ranging between zero and one the
notions of inclusion union intersection complement relation convexity
etc are extended to such sets and various properties of these notions in the
context of fuzzy sets are established in particular a separation theorem for
convex fuzzy sets is proved without requiring that the fuzzy sets be disjoint

in science and technology user studies are numerous and have a
history of some twenty years the relevance of the methodology
of science user studies to the social sciences is considered in
chapter 2 the pressing need in user studies in science as well
as social science is for a general body of theory about the flow
of information in research and teaching communities some of the
fundamental characteristics of social science research and its
literature which have a bearing upon investigations of information
needs and requirements are considered in the first part of chapter
3 and the second part is devoted to a review of empirical studies
in the social sciences other relevant material about the use made
of information is discussed in chapter 4 on systematic approaches

in a day when it is hard enough in most fields of science to
keep abreast of new and nonredundant literature the
publication of collected papers like the estate of holy
matrimony is something not to be undertaken unadvisedly
lightly or wantonly in the present case it would not have been
considered at all but for the kindly initiative of my respected
friend professor roman jakobson whose persistent encouragement
alone overcame that distaste which most of us feel
for our ten to twentyyearold productions and brought this
first volume to the point of no return it is true that these
exploratory papers were scattered among an unconscionably
awkward selection of publications for anyone wanting to
follow them up on the other hand as most of them were
written for specific occasions each of which demanded some
rehearsal of points covered in earlier essays the resulting
repetitiveness presented a special problem with occasional
exceptions redundancy could have been eliminated only
at the cost of mutilating individual papers the solution
adopted has been to leave almost all repetitive passages
intact offsetting in small print those that can be skipped
without loss by readers of the earlier chapters where some
comment has seemed necessary by way of foreword or
postscript to the original papers the passages added have
been italicized

this book is concerned primarily with those intellectual factors that
significantly affect the performance of all information retrieval systems
namely

 indexing policy and practice
 vocabulary control
 searching strategies
 interaction between the system and its users

my viewpoint is that of the evaluator of information systems i have
therefore paid considerable attention to a discussion of the requirements
of users of information systems and the measurement of system performance
in terms of the efficient and economical satisfaction of these requirements
the book does not concern itself except indirectly with equipment
for the implementation of retrieval systems a topic that is adequately
covered by other volumes in this seris moreover it is my contention that
the importance of hardware and data processing aspects of information
systems has been exaggerated in the united states with some detriment
to the performance of many systems

this book deals with online systems for bibliographic search and
retrieval the literature on this subject is increasing rapidly and new systems
are appearing all the time we have attempted to provide a broad survey of
the characteristics capabilities and limitations of present systems our
emphasis is on the design evaluation and use of online retrieval systems
primarily from the viewpoint of the planner and manager of information
services it is oriented toward the intellectual aspects of information
retrieval rather than the hardware or programming aspects we hope that
this book may have some value for all students of library and information

expended to create more understanding of the processes involved in
information storage retrieval and dissemination too often concepts
deriving from science and technology are made to seem unnecessarily
abstruse either inadvertently or deliberately to preserve some sort of
mystique this book is intended to explicate if not popularize major

the present book embodies a change in structure and focus to reflect
the fact that the reader of todays book is much more likely to be an
interested college student with a great awareness of the current information
revolution than was the case ten years ago thus hardware materials and
processes used in connection with information systems are discussed first
in chapters two through four the subject of information retrieval per se
begins with chapters five and six which have to do with librarianship
and documentation because of their somewhat historical slant these
chapters along with seven are the only ones taken from the 1963 book
which adhere to their original character chapter seven presents a simplified
concept of an information system and its components and paves the way for
discussion of computerized retrieval in the chapters to follow especially
for data retrieval in chapter eight and document retrieval in chapter nine
chapters ten through twelve on language processing evaluation and user
studies describe important facets of the information retrieval field that have
developed strongly since 1963

the notion of similarity as defined in this paper is essentially a
generalization of the notion of equivalence in the same vein a fuzzy ordering
is a generalization of the concept of ordering for example the relation
x  y is a fuzzy linear ordering in the set of real numbers
more correctly a similarity relation s is a fuzzy relation which is
reflexive symmetric and transitive
various properties of similarity relations and fuzzy ordering are
investigated and as an illustration an extended version of szpilrajns

the two studies presented here represent efforts
to measure the performance of library staffs in an unobstrusive
fashion that is to apply certain tests generally
similar to portions of the normal workload without drawing
attention to the fact that a test is being carried out the
two projects were rather different as to purpose method
and reliability of result that is statistical significance
dr crowleys investigation the first in point of time
arose partly from his experience in a county library his
curiousity about the real result of the reference activities
as different from merely counting the questions answered
led him to ask is there substantial difference between the
claims made by librarians for reference work and the actual
result as observed in a number of different situations by
individuals posing as clients the study which followed
from this question was then exploratory and necessarily
less rigidly controlled than was the second study of this

this book deals with the simplest of the three corrective measures 
the improvement of the document retrieval system there are different
ways and means of accomplishing this and these methods of improving
the organization and retrieval of personal document collections are the
principal topics to be covered the book is addressed primarily to the
researcher in any subject field who desires to improve the index to his
document collection or start an index to his document collection but does
not quite know how to go about it an index is herein defined as a
systematic organization of a collection of documents or data there are
indexes to various types of document and data collections and there are
various types of indexes examples of familiar indexes are indexes to
individual books to collections of books the card catalog in a library
to the contents of journals or periodicals for example the readers guide
to periodical literature to collections of facts for example a telephone
directory or to numeric data such as physical constants of a group
of compounds or numeric data collected in a questionnaire study

a structured questionnaire was administered to professional personnel in
industrial and government organizations asking the subjects to rank eight
information gathering methods according to their preference in given
hypothetical situation the subjects were then asked to rate the methods on a
seven point scale according to a ease of use and b amount of information
expected the subjects were divided into two groups determined by their time
spent in research or research related activities the groups were designated
research and nonresearch
a statistical analysis of the data from 96 subjects 52 in research 44 in
nonresearch showed that no statistically significant differences were present
in either the rankings or ratings between research and nonresearch personnel
the results of the study infer that the ease of use of an information
gathering method is more important than the amount of information expected for
information gathering methods in industrial and government regardless of the
research orientation of the users

there are two major purposes in mind for this gathering the first is the
most general that can be proposed for any gathering the simple advantage of
bringing together those who have been at work on a single problem or at least
a small class of problems  especially when this problem has not previously
benefited from exclusive and thematic collaboration among its investigators
to further such thematic collaboration the formal presentations have been
scheduled no more than three each day with time left after each presentation
for formal discussion here in the conference room and with as much time as
possible  given the number of presentations  left free for informal
discussion
the second purpose is one of even greater necessity in my opinion though
one not so obvious as the first over and above the hope for interchange of
what has already been thought out  in the form of personal contact where
the presence of the originator of the system or theory can reinforce the
printed word in its usual and ineffable way  it is my hope that we will all
be able especially in our informal discussions to penetrate beyond mere
similarity and difference to the underlying philosophical bases of syntactic
relationship

the machine language information language in our terminology ds
should not be confused with the machine code upenskii 59357 in
ranganathans more general terms there should be no confusion between the
idea plane and the notational plane many difficulties in classification
arise from this confusion this paper is devoted mainly to problems on
the idea plane
the irlanguage i want to talk about is the language in which the
information to be retrieved is formulated ie a declarative sentence
language not the imperative sentence language of the programmerretriever
bohnert in samet 62110 that is the information language should not
be confused with the programming language to avoid misunderstandings
it would perhaps be better to say descriptive instead of declarative
and to state explicitly that in a descriptive sentence an imperative may
be described which is however not to be executed by the system but to
be retrieved by appropriate searches

all analysis of information for storage and of questions for effecting
retrieval must be in terms of concepts and the relations between them
the concepts may be just words descriptors as in simple postcoordinate
keyword indexing systems or they may be classterms or other ideagroupings
as in classifications the relations between concepts often appear to be
absent but if more than one word is used in indexing or in a search there is
clearly an implicit relation between them in the mind of the indexer or
questioner and other relations possible between the words would lead to
false drops classification has traditionally been a method of organization
of concepts in which the relations between concepts are ostensibly displayed
in the form of groupings called classes

recent research at the cambridge language research unit has been concerned
with the application of the automatic classification techniques associated with
the theory of clumps to document description obtained from the aslibcranfield
project and with the use of the resulting term classifications in retrieval
a substantial program engine has been developed which computes similarities
between pairs of terms on the basis of their occurrences and cooccurrences in
document descriptions and finds classes of terms with strong similarity
connections by minimizing the cohesion between a potential clump and its
complement and which retrieves using single terms andor term classes
according to specification and calculates recall and precision ratios for sets
of requests serious tests with different similarity and clump definitions and
with different modes of using term classes are still in progress so on
definite conclusions about the value of this kind of classification are
presented

an articulated subject index is one in which logical transformations of
natural language phrases containing prepositions or connectives are employed to
organize the noun phrases as subject headings with subordinate displays of the
remainder of the phrases the bestknown example of the articulated subject
index is that to chemical abstracts
it has been shown that a welldefined transformation links the entry as it
appears in the index with the original phrase in natural order as it was
first compiled by the indexer a reverse transformation can be used to
generate potential index entries from indexing phrases containing one or more
prepositions or connectives
a simple model has been devised for the generation of articulated subject
index entries from natural language indexing phrases which exclude infinitives
or words acting as gerunds or participles a sorting algorithm has also been
developed the purpose of which is to select those entries which lead to
greatest organization in the index display
deviations from the model in manuallyproduced indexes are described the
potential value of certain of these characteristics in information retrieval
is examined

operation in a timeshared environment it is a useroriented system with
planned capabilities for the browsing and manmachine interaction

online dialog via terminals with a body of scientific information each
usersubmitted inquiry is a set of sentences without restriction as to
vocabulary or form the system converses with the user to obtain

two widely used criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of information
retrieval system are respectively the recall and the precision since the
determination of these measures is dependent on a distinction between documents
which are relevant to a given query and documents which are not relevant to that
query it has sometimes been claimed that an accurate generally valid
evaluation cannot be based on recall and precision measures
a study was made to determine that effect of variations in relevance
assessments on the average recall and precision values used to measure
retrieval effectiveness using a collection of 1200 documents in information
science for test purposes it is found that large scale differences in the
relevance assessments do not produce significant variations in average recall
and precision it thus appears that properly computed recall and precision
data may represent effectiveness indicators which are generally valid for many
distinct user classes

the information retrieval process treated strictly as a matching procedure
has the defects that tha whole file must be probed for each query and that it
overlooks the fact that the relevance of the information from one document
depends upon what is already known about the subject and in term affects the
relevance of other documents subsequently examined a mathematical model of a
search technique in which the defects of the direct method are taken into account
is demonstrated by an experiment in which a given paper is treated as an enquiry
and the references cited in the paper are treated as relevant answers the
results in two tests show much better results than those achieved by the direct
method no spurious material was retrieved by either method

the most challenging task in preparing an index to a book is to select all
and only those terms that are related to the text and are useful for relevance
purposes while a knowledgeable human can make the selection on an intuitive
basis automatic indexing requires a precise operational criterion for defining
and selecting good and useful index terms two principles of selection are
proposedspecification and selection of useful terms and specification and
exclusion of useless terms because of the nebulous nature and meaning of
good index terms and the difficulties involved in devising machine algorithms
for their selection this research in automatic indexing is based on the
principle of excluding useless terms even sofully automatic indexing was not
achieved in this study single words proved to be little value as index terms
multiple word terms were generated by the computer but no algorithm could
successfully eliminate the useless phrases final selection had to be made by
the experimenter a comprehensive and useful book index was achieved by using
machineaided rather than fully automated indexing techniques

the economic merits of applying computers in information storage retrieval
and dissemination have usually been considered with respect only to the cost of
operating the information services concerned this had tended to indicate that
computer use is economically justified mainly for housekeeping operations in
the large scale organizations
the present paper takes a wider view and included in its appraisal the costs
involved in information gathering and dissemination for the total system
representing the information services and its users it is suggested that the
inclusion of cost elements associated with user time devoted to information
gathering tends to shift the economic appraisal in favor of computer application
in information work
in fact such computer use appears to find its main stimulus and economic
justification in an environment that provides strong incentives to minimize
the total cost of the system whilst maximizing its benefits to the users
to illustrate this some example are given based on experience gained in
research data handling and the operation of sdi services in an industrial
research establishment

the purpose of an informationretrieval system is to provide the user with
citations relevant to his query since the user is the only person competent
to make the final judgement of relevance it is natural to suppose that the
selection of items from a data base will lead to two kinds of retrieval
error the extent of these errors is expressed by the familiar measures
of performance precision and recall precision measures the failure of the
system to retrieve only relevant documents while recall measures its failure
to retrieve all relevant documents actually present in the data base it is
difficult to visualize a situation in which a user would find advantage in
being provided with irrelevant citations from the users point of view
therefore a system which offers less than 100 per cent precision is a
deficient system

computer searches on chemical titles tapes for current awareness at the
university of alberta since may 1968 have provided sufficient data to allow
formulation of a cost function based on the number of titles searched the
length of questions the extent to which questions may be batched and certain
details regarding the allowed forms of question with different choice of
parameters the cost function could be adapted to apply to searches of other data
bases
an attempt to make retrospective searching economically feasible has led to
formulation of different search techniques it is suggested that the search
procedure should be designed to minimize computation time at the expense of
convenience in the form of output but that facilities should be included so
that the user who is willing to play the additional cost may receive output in
a more convenient form
in recognition of the fact that the form of search question should be
dependent on the vocabulary of the data base a program has been developed to
modify a question so that it is optimal for searches on the given data base

this presentation on economic aspects of information retrieval is based
on data gathered by project urbandoc during the course of four years in
developing documentation services for the literature of urban planning
and renewal it was a substantial effort  half a million dollars is
no small sum in the social sciences  made possible by an urban renewal
demonstration grant from the us department of housing and urban development
hud to the city university of new york the proposal that initiated the
project in 1965 grew out of the extensive dissatisfaction with bibliographic
services in planning librarianship at a time when both planners and librarians
were looking to data processing to solve a variety of information problems
urbandoc was to apply the techniques of scientific documentation to a body of
literature which had been neglected by the information science community before
the advent of computerization and completely bypassed by it afterwards

many of the largescale mechanized information systems in operation today
grew up because of the need of the military and paramilitary establishments
to have rapid access to large quantities of scientific and technological
information this paper will deal with two complementary efforts in the
field of social sciences where an awareness of the information problem is
acute and the global needs staggering the target audiences for these two
systems are on the one hand social science researchers and on the other
policy planners and makers in the broad field of economic and social
development
an operational system in the international labour office will be
described and an array of figures representing actual or theoretical
operating costs will be given as could be expected however these
figures relate only to costs of systems development input preparation
file maintenance and retrieval no attempt can be made to evaluate in other
than general terms the economic impact that the existence of such a system
may have it can be readily demonstrated however that computerassisted
information systems may make sense within individual institutional
environments and make greater sense when online systems linking
various collaborating institutions can result in enabling each to operate
more efficiently and at lower cost the existence of such online
networks would make the greatest sense for users because of the possibility
of having access at a reasonable price to large information stores

this article reports on several experiments in automatic extracting and one
experiment in automating indexing nine chapters each from a different
technical book were used as a text corpus for all the experiments in the
first experiment an attempt was made to construct a sentence dictionary of
syntactic sentence types for distinguishing extractworthy sentences but it
proved unrewarding nevertheless the results indicated that sentence typing
might be used in a screening process in conjunction with other extracting
techniques the later attempts to combine synactic and statistical criteria
in the choice of extract sentences and index phrases proved more rewarding
the sentences selected by the extracting algorithm were representative and
are presented for the reader to peruse the noun phrases selected by the
indexing algorithm compared favorably with the backofthebook index phrases
there is every indication that satisfactory backofthebook indexes could be
produced automatically with postediting to delete superfluous items

to date the many decisions among alternatives that are required in the
course of developmental efforts to improve indexing have with few exceptions
been guided primarily by criteria related to effectiveness as measured by some
objective method or as judged subjectively although effectivenesstype
criteria may be adequate for work intended solely to advance the
stateoftheart when the goal is to develop indexing techniques appropriate
for operating services it seems highly desirable to employ some criterion that
takes cost as well as effectiveness into consideration the central problem of
operating services can be reduced to either that of producing the best indexing
possible at a given cost or that of producing indexing of a given level of
effectiveness at least cost in our current effort to develop rules for human
machine and manmachine indexing we employ a costeffectiveness type of
criterion in making the critical developmental decision the general approach
is described and illustrated with examples of how measures of cost and of
effectiveness were considered jointly in decision making primarily for how to
reduce cost of indexing at a given level of effectiveness problems of
defining cost are also discussed such as how to divide indexing into discrete
steps the effects of longterm vs shortterm activity in humans and
smallbatch vs largebatch considerations for machines

a thesaurus can be defined as a structured vocabulary for use in information
storage and retrieval systems
three parts of this definition need further elaboration
1 a vocabulary is a collection of terms
2 the structure of a vocabulary can be described as a set of relationships
between terms
3 utilization of a thesaurus in an information system involves a set of
rules which take into account the characteristics of the system

we present completely automatic procedures for the selfgeneration of
meaningful groups among the members of a document collection and for the
classification according to these groups of subsequent documents these
procedures operate on large document collections with reasonably short
computation times thus far in our experiments on the physics literature
automatic classification has proven to be as good as or better than manual
indexing and in addition potentially less expensive empirically derived
our method is based upon a pattern discovery algorithm which use only the
citation content of a document and with operates on the bibliographic links
among papers the selfgenerated groups correspond to very specific subject
headings retrospective bibliographies generated in the procedures allow one
to classify the subsequent literature with remarkably high recall and
relevance ratios close to 100

years old in these 5 years arist became not only a very much used and quoted
tool but also an established institution this is testified by the fact that
each of the five volumes was the years most frequently and most comprehensively
reviewed book in the field the arist effort is unparalleled in great many
fields
currently we are entering an era of intense concern about and reactions to
science and technology all sciences and technologies are subject to
questioning scrutiny and evaluation both inside and outside of their subject
areas
scrutiny of a field may be attempted by a scrutiny of its important

retrospective search of large document data bases requires development of
special techniques for automatic compression of data and minimization of the
number of inputoutput operations to the computer accessible files also the
computer program should be designed to require a relatively small amount of
internal memory
the present paper contains a description of the structure of a program that
meets the above requirements the vocabulary of the data base is automatically
expressed in terms of 8 16 and 24 bit codes chosen to point to the natural
spelling in a dictionary thus file size is reduced without the necessity for
extensive processing for decoding use of a compressed bit string inverted
index greatly reduces search time and a storage management system enables long
strings to be processed with use of a limited amount of internal storage
creation of reduced files and tables is an important feature of a program it
allows the files needed only by specific phases of the program to be designed
to use a relatively small amount of internal storage and inputoutput time

examined in detail the model incorporates an objective function based on
expected usage as a measure of journal worth and cost constraints which
account for the scarcity of capital the model can be used to aid the
librarian in making better selection decisions since the objective function
can be shown to reflect the evaluation of the library as an information

a system of automatic indexing based on bayes theorem is described
briefly in assigning 124 documents to 9 categories there were 97 cases of
agreement with professional indexers using a collection factor based on 87
per cent human consistency from other courses the computer appears then to
index with 90 per cent accuracy in this case
the technique is then used with two randomized sample document groups drawn
from nine categories each group in turn is used as the basis for indexing the
other the computer knows only the number of categories after 8 cycles the
computer is found to have formed 9 groups consisting of about 50 per cent of
documents that were also lumped together by professional indexers on the basis
of subject content

measures of cost were employed a computer processing charge expressed in
dollars and the number of documents retrieved a measure of work that must be
expended to review the retrieved items the measure of performance was an
estimate of the recall ratio
to obtain the requisite measures an experimental plan was developed in which
experts searched the data base of psychological abstracts forming their queries
from written statements of information needs these statements along with the
list of documents relevant to them were produced by people with information
problems tallies were kept of the number of documents retrieved before each
of the designed relevant items were found the major findings are noted
below
1 queries to the system employing simple boolean operators and or have
better costperformance characteristics than queries using more elegant
searching operators
2 ondemand access to the index or dictionary contributes sizeably to
improving the costperformance of the system
3 the argument is raised that human factors such as the differences among
users of a system probably should be a major factor in the design operation
and evaluation of retrieval systems it appears that consideration of these

the personal literature search of a scientist is strongly governed by
subjective influences if he delegates his literature search he should always
be aware of the problems necessarily emanating from his subjective view this
prevents him from imposing unsatisfiable demands on the delegated search
particularly with respect to its expected performance and makes him conscious
of the fact that in order to satisfy his entire information need he cannot
dispense with the browsing serendipity of his personal literature search he
will also better understand the peculiarities of the documentary methods needed
for operating large and continuously growing systems as compared with the
methods sufficient for his personal file
the information scientist on the other hand in charge of establishing
operating and evaluating retrieval systems of high performance and survival
power should take into consideration the pronouncedly subjective character of
fundamental notions such as information and order this gives him a better
understanding of the kind of inquiries submitted to him and of the inherently
even if latently subjective character of several fundamental operations in
storage and retrieval and will cause him to refrain from futile attempts to
make such operations more objective and formal such a better mutual
understanding will be bound to promote advance in methodology and psychology of
scientific communication

this book is concerned primarily with those intellectual factors that
significantly affect the performance of all information retrieval systems
namely
 indexing policy and practice
 vocabulary control
 searching control
 interaction between the system and its users
my viewpoint is that of the evaluator of information systems i have
therefore paid considerable attention to a discussion of the requirements
of users of information systems and the measurement of system performance
in terms of the efficient and economical satisfaction of these requirements
the book does not concern itself except indirectly with equipment
for the implementation of retrieval systems a topic that is adequately
covered by other volumes in this series moreover it is my contention that
the importance of hardware and data processing aspects of information
systems has been exaggerated in the united states with some detriment
to the performance of many systems

statements on these as subjects and may therefore be
defined as the whole of true and possible predicates
that can be collected on a given subject it is
from these predicates that the characteristics of the

relations between concepts which relations in turn are
factors for the formation of concept systems
different kinds of relationships as well as different
kinds of concepts are distinguished it is pointed
out that an orderly supply of the elements for
propositions information statements on new knowledge
requires the construction and availability of such
concept systems

a common tool for the selection of serial publications for a research
library is the lists of most cited serials the possibilities of this method
were first studied by gross and gross who in 1927 applied a method of
sample statistical investigation to the grading of scientific serials
according to their relative importance based on citation counting from source
journals

as the formal communication system of science has become less able to
supply information with the rapidity that scientists require increasing
attention has been paid to the structure of communication in science how are
scientific publications utilized by scientists what is accomplished by the
circulation of scientific information on an informal basis how does the social
organization among scientists facilitate or inhibit these processes
three types of studies have been conducted in this area a studies of the
scientific literature itself b studies of how scientists obtain the
information which they need for their research and c studies of the
relationship between scientists who conduct research in the same areas for the
most part studies of formal communication and information gathering have been
conducted in the absence of all but the most rudimentary theoretical models as
has been pointed out in at least three recent reviews of these studies libbey
and zaltman 1967 p 64 paisley 1968 storer 1968 p 12 the lack of
theory can be attributed partly to the practical orientation of many of the
studies and also to the fact that an adequate model cannot be based on any one
of these types of studies alone a useful theory must integrate knowledge from
all three types in this article we will review these studies and will
describe a teoretical model which has been designed to fill this purpose

the great concern with scientific communication in the last few decades has
produced a number of studies analyzing the use of information one approach to
these matters has been via the citation study  a method often used in the physical
sciences but applied less frequently in the humanities and social sciences
however in the latter area enough citation studies have been completed to
produce material for interesting comparisons

on the 14th and 15th of january 1971 a workshop on the user
interface for interactive search of bibliographic data bases was held at
rickys hyatt house in palo alto california the workshop sponsored by
the information systems committee of the american federation of
information processing societies brought together a group of information
scientists who have been directly involved with this subject area they were
provided in advance with a challenge paper and with a number of papers
prepared in response to that challenge the workshop sessions themselves
were devoted exclusively to focussed discussions of the material and of the
problems in and the prospects for more effective systems design of the user
interface the content of these two days of deliberation prompted making
the substance of the workshop experience available to a larger audience

in one broad category of theories the problems are expressed
in terms of actualities of events in group relations as they
exist in everyday life on the whole theories advanced by
many social scientists fall in this broad category in this
concern over actualities the problem is frequently not stated and
discussion not developed in a way that can be tested rigorously
in the second broad category of theories problems are stated
and analysis carried out in terms of more rigorousappearing
concepts and units of analysis theories coming from psychologists
and social scientists heavily influenced by them fall within
this broad category in this line of approach theories are
advanced without due regard to actualities and consequently

interlibrary loan transactions involving academic libraries in the united
states numbered over 800000 items in 196364 this number is growing
exponentially large libraries report that they cannot fill about a third
of the interlibrary loan requests they receive unfilled interlibrary loans
are costly to both the borrowing and the lending libraries and reduce the
usefulness of the service to the reader many of these interlibrary loan
failures are preventable chiefly by publishing policies of the lending
libraries to prevent borrowers from requesting noncirculating materials and
by determining in advance what library owns the item wanted
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>551</DOCNO>
in 197273 approximately 194000 interlibrary loan requests
were not filled because the borrowing library in ignorance
requested noncirculating material contrary to the
interlibrary lending policies of the lending library these
unfilled requests probably cost the borrowing and lending
libraries over 400000 in wasted manpower besides
disappointing readers who waited in vain for their materials
much of this waste could be prevented if borrowing libraries check
in advance the lending policies before sending requests
the major elements determining whether or not libraries
receive requests to borrow from libraries at a distance are
whether the library lists unusual materials in union lists
especially the national union catalog the union list of
serials and new serial titles and whether it has strong
collections in a subject field listed in library directories
volume of outofstate lending is related to the type of
lending library the size of collection budget for current
acquisitions number of periodicals received photocopy
charges population density in neighboring states proximity
to other libraries and completeness of reporting holdings in
the national union catalog or other bibliographic centers

our survey in other words is offered within the bounds of descriptive
or deductive statistics which seeks to analyze a group not attempt to estimate
the parameters of that population of which the group has been chosen as a
sample the latter role is assumed by inductive statistics which makes use
of probability sampling accordingly our data are presented in those forms
and with those statistical measures appropriate to the methods of descriptive
statistics arrays frequency distributions breakdowns by categories which
seem of optimum value to the librarian and administrator eg the frequency
of requests for journals versus monographs the age of journals requested
the types and ages of materials requested by the various types of libraries

this book is an introduction to the field of information science
and technology with particular emphasis on document organization
its point of view is general in the sense that it attempts to deal with
types of problems rather than particular systems when particular
systems are described they are used as examples of systems rather
than as models
the method of presentation is expository at the introductory
level while differing points of view are frequently noted this book
is not intended to provide definitive critical evaluation relevant
research is reviewed in order to indicate current thinking and activities
in the field

the main emphasis of this book is on work of a theoretical
and experimental nature rather than on practical
applications however the articles selected are viewed
as having a considerable potential in two major respects
they have important implications for the practice of
information handling but even more important they contain
aspects of generalization the book is oriented
toward basic and experimental work such as that
performed by traditional sciences with the hope that a
reader may find much relevant to his own interests
educational level and background a bridge toward
generalizations a feeling of interconnection between
seemingly unrelated works either presented in the book or
found in the literature an awareness of apparent gaps in
knowledge and even ideas for practical solutions or
further theoretical or experimental work

librarianship classifies as a social science because the library as an
institution is a creature of society and its goal is the improvement of
society by helping the individual to understand himself and the world of
which he is a part but the library is also concerned with man as a
rational being thus it remains primarily a humanistic enterprise the
traditional lines of demarcation among the disciplines are breaking down
and in certain areas becoming almost obliterated and librarianship in
both its technology and its services is drawing ever closer to the social
and physical sciences but we would do well to remind ourselves of the
librarys humanistic origins otherwise in excessive enthusiasm for the
technology of science and the social action of the behaviorist we may lose
sight of the individual and his needs and the humanistic values implicit
in them

this programmed text has been developed from work initially carried out
under a research project funded by the office for scientific and technical
information now the british library research and development
department the project designed to investigate the applicability of the
techniques of programmed instruction in the teaching of practical subject
indexing was conducted at the school of librarianship the polytechnic
of north london in cooperation with the college of librarianship wales
the programmed instruction course written during this project and used
by students at both schools of librarianship forms the basis of the
programmed text
most of the existing programmed texts relevant to the field of practical
subject indexing are concerned with the translation stage of indexing and
aim to impart skills in the use of particular indexing languages our
intention in the abovementioned project was to produce a course of
programmed instruction which presented an integrated view of the basic
principles and practices of subject indexing rather than attempting to
impart to the student a high degree of familiarity with any particular
system

the general systems theory pioneered by von bertalanffy
kenneth boulding anatol rapoport and their collaborators gives us a
theoretical instrument for assuring the mutual relevance of scientific
information and philosophic meaning extended into a general systems
philosophy this instrument can polarize the contemporary theoretical scene
as a magnet polarizes a field of charged particles by ordering the formerly
random segments into a meaningful pattern if made good use of this
instrument could channel to us a stream of informed as well as sophisticated
answers through the crossfertilization of contemporary science and
philosophy
this then is my credo the conviction which led to the formulation of the
present introduction to systems philosophy over a period of three years
of research in alternating states of euphoria and dejection

any previous training in the subject but it does assume that
the reader  especially the reader whose educational background like
my own is more in the humanities than in mathematics and
science  is prepared to make a certain intellectual effort with respect
to the use of symbols and formulae few subjects suffer more than
linguistics from the separation of the sciences and the humanities
that is still maintained in the curricula of most of our schools ad
universities for contemporary linguistic theory draws simultaneously
and in roughly equal measure upon the more traditional approach
to language that is characteristic of the humanities and the more
scientific approach that has developed recently in connection with
advances that have been made in formal logic computer science and
automata theory

the last ten years have witnessed the growth of
an intense public interest in university affairs almost anything
to do with universities is now headline news previously such attention
as they did receive was limited to brief reports in sober middle class
newspapers of appointments awards and meetings leavened once a
year by an obligatory account in all newspapers of the boat race
all this has changed as michael befoff comments in his book the
plateglass universities having made the foregoing points and more
besides what were once ivory towers have now become goldfish
bowls
he goes on to give the obvious explanation for the change
universities are of public interest because they are now almost wholly
supported by the taxpayers money they represent a massive investment
on the part of the government and consequently are expected to
yield a vitally important return in trained and educated manpower
over the last twenty years government expenditure in this country
on universities has risen from four million pounds a year to more
than two hundred million pounds a year the total university student
population is in excess of two hundred thousand and teaching and
research staff number approximately twentyfive thousand

contemporary models of research and development are incomplete in that they
ignore the many reappraisals and budgeting decisions that occur in the time
between a projects proposal and its commercialization the sequential
decision aspects of project budgeting are particularly important since 1 the
research expenditure is usually an order of magnitude less than the irrevocable
investment for commercialization and 2 an allocation to a project today does
not presuppose continuation of the project into future periods
the research and development budgeting problem is structured to take into
account the sequential decision characteristic utilizing the technique of
dynamic programming methods are developed to determine optimal project budgets
when the aggregate research and development budget is either constrained or
unconstrained these models also suggest a rational explanation of the
patterns of project expenditures over time that one observes in practice
finally some of the shortcomings of the developed methods which inhibit
their practical application are discussed

this paper describes an all computer document retrieval system which can find
documents related to a request even though they may not be indexed by the exact
terms of the request and can present these documents in the order of their
relevance to the request the key to this ability lies in the application of a
statistical formula by which the computer calculates the degree of association
between pairs of index terms with proper manipulation of these associations
entirely within the machine a vocabulary of synonyms near synonyms and other
words closely related to any given term or group of terms is derived such a
vocabulary related to a group of request terms is believed to be a much more
powerful tool for selecting documents from a collection than has been available
heretofore by noting the number of matching terms between this extended list
of request terms and the terms used to index a document and with due regard
for their degree of association documents are selected by the computer and
arranged in the order of their relevance to the request

starting with a collection of 405 document abstracts dealing with
computers the experiment in automatic document classification proceeds
to construct an
empirically based mathematically derived classification system by use of a
factor analysis technique the documents are then classified into these
derived categories by five subjects and the resulting classification serves
as a criterion against which the automatic classification is to be evaluated
of the 90 documents in the validation group which contained two or more clue
words and which therefore could be automatically classified 44 documents or
489 per cent were placed into their correct categories by use of a computer
formula these results are almost identical to the results obtained by maron
in a previous experiment using the same data but with a different set of
classification categories and a different computational formula the
experimental evidence support the conclusion that automatic document
classification is possible additional experiments are described which when
executed should improve the accuracy of the automatic classification
technique

terms are drawn from the vocabulary of a structured indexing system and may
consist of single words collection of words or syntactic phrases the basic
idea is that a measure of the semantic association between index terms can be
determined from the structural relationships which the terms exhibit by their
relative positions in the system the association measure which is based on a
priori preassigned semantic relationships between terms rather than their
cooccurrence in a document corpus is then for grouping index terms into
clusters or concepts some results of an experimental investigation are

pattern recognition has been introduced to the
chemical literature as a general tool which can be used
by the chemist to reduce masses of experimental data to
relevant information perhaps more importantly it
provides connections between raw multivariant data
and soughtfor information without making restrictive
assumptions about the underlying statistics of the data
the general problem has been stated as follows given
a collection of objects and a list of measurements made
on each object is it possible to find andor predict a
property of the objects that is not directly measurable
but is known to be related to the measurements via
some unknown relationship the only assumption
made is that similarities and dissimilarities among
objects are reflected in at least some of the
measurements

chemical structure a unique and invariant linear name which includes double
bond and asymmetric carbon isomerism a logical proof is given for the
onetoone correspondence between name and structure by inspection of the
linear names of two structures one can determine if the two structures are
identical nonisometric constitutionally isometric diastereometric or
enantiometric the algorithm determines the true stereocenters and calculates
a reduced set of chiral centers src it is proven that if three are any
centers in src that the compound must be chiral an a chiral compound must have
src  null extensions of the algorithm are outlined to allow uniquely naming
conformational isomers

we discuss how alternative methods of automatic
term clustering may provide insight into how terms are
related within a corpus the work reported uses a
corpus of 2267 documents that contain 3950 index
terms a similarity matrix is developed using the
document  term matrix a threshold level t is applied to
the similarity matrix entries in the matrix that are
greater than or equal to the threshold level are set
equal to one and the remaining entries are set to zero
three definitions are applied to the corresponding
graph of each threshold matrix to develop clusters
these are 1 the connected components of the graph
2 the maximal complete subgraphs of the graph and
3 the combined maximal complete subgraphs of the
graph as described that show how insight may be
gained into the term relations by varying the threshold
levels and the cluster definitions

together with the increasing shortage of qualified abstracts the factors
of time cost and value have lent impetus to a trend toward the automatic
generation of abstracts and indexes this trend has caused increased emphasis
to be placed on the abstract as the locus of data for automatic retrieval
systems this necessitates the creating of high quality abstracts it is the
purpose of this paper to report on the development of techniques for the
automatic production of high quality abstracts from the full text of the
original document it is necessary to analyze the conditions under which
various methods of sentence selection are successful in order to develop
criteria for selecting sentences to form an abstract but clearly an abstract
can be produced by rejecting sentences of the original which are irrelevant to
the abstract as will be seen it is this point which is perhaps the most
significant contribution of this paper methods of sentence selection and
rejection are discussed these include contextual inference intersentence
reference frequency criteria and coherency considerations the automatic
abstracting system we have developed consists basically of a dictionary called
the word control list and of a set of rules for implementing certain functions
specified for each wcl entry the abstracts we have obtained so far are of
sufficiently good quality to indicate that largescale testing of the methods
of the automatic abstracting system is warranted

this paper defines the relationship between linguistics
and information science in terms of a common interest
in natural language the notion of automated processing
of natural language  ie machine simulation of
the language processing activities of a human  provides
novel possibilities for interaction between linguists
who have a theoretical interest in such activities
and information scientists who have more practical
goals eg simulating the language processing activities
of an indexer with a machine
the concept of a natural language information system
is introduced as a framework for reviewing automated
language processing effort by computational
linguists and information scientists in terms of this
framework the former have concentrated on automating
the operations of the component for content analysis
and representation while the latter have emphasized
the data management component the complementary
nature of these developments allows the
postulation of an integrated approach to automated
language processing this approach which is outlined
in the final sections of the paper incorporates current
notions in linguistic theory and information science as
well as design features of recent computational linguistic
models

a decision theory approach is used to model the information retrieval
decision problem of which documents to retrieve from a library collection in
response to a specific user query for information a thorough discussion of
decision theory including the components of the alternativesstatesofnature
outcomes and evaluations  as well as of the optimization process under the
cases of certainty risk and uncertainty  is presented bayesian statistics
are also discussed to show how prior information about the various documents
via classification analysis can affect the decision process under risk an
example problem is used to illustrate the decision theory approach and to
compare tha overall performance of the retrieval system under risk with and
without document classification information
thus the operations research technique of decision theory is used to model
the retrieval decision process illustrate how important evaluation is and to
demonstrate the value of prior information via document classification
analysis moreover the paper presents in a somewhat tutorial mode an
overall framework for considering the information retrieval decision problem
incorporating the aspects of costeffectiveness and alternative evaluation
which allows one to better understand the contributions made by many

stage describes an experiment that explores properties
of the class of words that are not useful in conveying
subject meaning and distinguishes them from those
classes of words that do convey subject meaning to
various degrees in particular we study the clustering
properties of these words the analysis is based on
statistical properties alone and techniques are
introduced that may be of value in other areas of
information science on the basis of the results of this
experiment a model of word occurrences is introduced and
discussed later papers by us and by harter will apply

an effective manmachine interactive retrieval system is not achieved by
simply placing a terminal on each end of an existing machine retrieval system
an interactive system requires a sequence of steps in which man and machine
alternately take action it should also provide different levels of services
to experienced and inexperienced searchers recognize the difference between a
narrow and broad query furnish clues as to the next direction to be searched
recognize the data base dynamically as the searcher changes his viewpoint
provide a ranking of responses in the most likely sequence and offer the
searcher the option of overriding the ranking when a particular term is of
extreme significance
an online interactive system meeting many of these needs has been developed
and tested the objectives of the development of this system browser was to
investigate the effectiveness of a freeform query with a combinatorial search
algorithm and the effectiveness of various techniques and components to
facilitate online browsing

the chemical abstracts service and engineering index inc began a fivepart
study to determine the relationships between and the overlap in coverage in
their printed publications and computerreadable services this study was
designed to provide information needed by these three accessing services for
planning future cooperative programs and for reconciling differences in policies
and practices so as to make their publications and services more useful to their
user communities
this paper is based on the first part of the study which compared listings
of the journals each service was routinely monitoring as of 1 may 1970 of the
14592 different journals monitored 1 were monitored by all three of the
services 27 were monitored by two of the three services and 72 were
monitored by only one of the three services subsequent phases of the study
will determine the extent to which the services cover the same articles within

the level of performance of this program known as the citation
identifier is high in a recent computer run the citation
identifier scanned ther full texts of 191 randomly selected decisions
of us court of appeals some 400000 words of running text and
located correctly 2220 fullform citations out of a total of 2227
that is better than 99 of the total only seven misses and three
false drops occurred
of 2220 fullform citations located correctly 1944 87 were
identified perfectly in addition there were 276 partial identifications
containing two types of errors 1 partial identifications in which some
citation terms were mistakenly lopped off by the program short hits
and 2 partial identifications that contained words improperly included
in the citations long hits
both types of errors are for the most part easily correctible and
can be largely eliminated by suitable changes in the program
the citation identifier operates rather rapidly in a recent test run
the total time required to process some 400000 running words of text
was approximately 15 12 minutes this speed could be further increased

the principles underlying alerting services are discussed general alerting
services as distinct from sdi systems need to transfer to their users a large
quantity of current but mainly irrelevent information as speedily as possible
as title indexes are the easiest to prepare and are therefore common the user

documents title this is estimated to be 2025 but can vary with subject and
type of information sought if a search of say chemical titles is made
ignoring synonyms but allowing for all syntactical variants only about one
third of the significant information will be recovered synonyms and other
nomenclature problems are discussed delay times and time of use are the two
most important factors in evaluating an alerting service and are reviewed for
some typical services

a librarian attempting to do a literature search currently
faces an eightmonth gap in access to the literature of
his field through library literature in april 1968
librarians made a rare examination of their own literature
and considered this gap and other information problems
in librarianship the albany conference on the bibliographic
control of library science literature recommended the
establishment of a fast announcement service for library
schools 1 a monthly keyword in context kwic index
serving the whole range of informationoriented professions
was a specific proposal which was favored by one conference
group to meet the need for current information 2

the state of the art literature review disclosed that society has not yet
come to the point that paying for library information services is a common
thing it was also found that a sound basis for determining the costs of the
services  let alone charge for them  does not exist while some data on
specific cost for unit operations are available it is very difficult to
compare the data and arrive at meaningful figures nevertheless there is an
indication that large operating centers are becoming concerned with cost to the
point that they are costaccording their operations which would permit them
to establish realistic fees for their services

arguments are advanced to suggest that information and operations on
information are phenomena the principles of which provide the basis for a
metascience of information informatology the fundamental character of the
phenomena is evidenced in the operations executed during the processing and
communication functions the role of the metascience is dictated by several
factors namely the need for a common basis upon which all information
oriented specialized sciences and technologies can be understood and studied
a common framework and language for all scientists and technologists concerned
in some form or other with information on one side and mans relationship
to the phenomena on the other side the content of the postulated metascience
of information is circumscribed by a list of specific questions and problems
for which the science has to provide answers and solutions it is suggested
that an educational concept responsive to the needs of metascience of
information be developed and implemented

an evaluation of the performance of index medicus and medlars in the field
of ophthalmology is presented using data generated by a separate study
medlars performance figures gave a screened precision ratio of 54 and a recall
ratio of 42 over the same set of questions index medicus had a screened
precision ratio of 53 and a recall ratio of 46 results for index medicus
alone over a large set of questions gave a 73 screened precision ratio and a
47 recall ratio a random sample of medlars and index medicus precision and
recall failures showed that most of the index medicus recall failures resulted
from manual searcher omission the major causes of medlars precision failures
were inadequate indexing terminalogy to express concepts and attempts at
providing too exhaustive a search

problems arising in the measurement of the rates of obsolescence of the sets
of periodicals taken by special libraries are discussed the relatively large
errors that arise in sampling the negative exponential distribution are
analyzed because they may account for some of the discrepancies reported and
because they indicate the need for firmer statistical control of work on
obsolescence than has yet been generally appreciated
when the rate of decline has been satisfactorily established there still
remains the problem of deciding how to apply it issues of those periodicals
that contribute most productively should be retained for a longer period than
those of periodicals that contribute less to solve this problem the concept
of utility contours is introduced and exemplified in the design of a p
library
it is argued that no discarding policy is likely to be generally applicable
every special library must be regarded as a special case rather than suggest
new measurements therefore the paper offers simple graphical techniques that
are applicable to any other special case

two groups of journals were identified as potential sources for
cardiovascular cv information the first group consists of 78 cv
specialty journals identified as cardiovascular from the title
these 78 emanate from 24 countries with about onehalf of the specialty
journals being published by 28 national and international societies the
second group of journals is composed of those journals used by grantees of
the national heart institute nhi to publish their findings
in fiscal 1967 5860 papers appearing in 789 journals were reported
to nhi taking the grantees of nhi as being representative of us
cv researchers it was found that the specialty journals were not the
most quantitatively fertile sources of cv information  only about 14
of american cv papers were published there the remaining 86 of the
literature was widely dispersed throughout 766 nonspecialty cv
journals
the extent of bibliographic control by the major indexing and
abstracting services was found to be more extensive for the topranking
journals in the nhi sample than for the group of cv specialty journals

the efficiency of keyworkincontext kwic permutedtitle indexes and
their numerous variations is highly dependent upon authors choices of titles
for their papers titles are important not only in commercial services
such as chemical titles basic current contents and ca condensates but
also in scanning primary journals and in traditional library services such
as bibliographies it is generally believed and often stated that titles
of chemical papers are becoming more informative as authors become
increasingly aware of the importance of titles as carriers of information
the present study was undertaken to test whether 1 titles of chemical papers
are becoming more informative and 2 whether uninformative titles of chemical
papers are being eliminated since the advent of the kwic index in 1958
the first hypothesis was tested by comparing titles published in 1948
1958 and 1968 by the following criteria 1 a count of substantive words
in the title 2 a count of all word matches between title and 10 leading
substantive words selected from the abstract with and without the use of a
thesaurus and 3 a count of word matches between title and 10 leading
substantive words selected from the abstract with and without the use of
a thesaurus the second hypothesis was tested by comparing a count of
short titles with 3 or less substantive words published in 1948 1958
and 1968
results confirm that uninformative titles of chemical papers are
being eliminated and that informative titles are becoming more informative
since the advent of the kwic index

the purpose of this paper is to present the elements of a basis for a
theory of information storage and retrieval it is believed that this theory
can best be formulated in terms of a general theory of indexing after stating
basic premises and defining essential concepts the relationship between a
theory of indexing and a theory of information storage and retrieval is
considered the similarities between the indexing process and the general
communication process are discussed and indexing is viewed as an order
increasing ie entropy decreasing operation the concept of a theoretical
index is developed and contrasted with realworld indexing systems the
relationship between query formulation retrieval and benefit is discussed
and these notions are then related to the human performance variable it is
believed that the ideas presented in this paper provide a useful framework
for more detailed investigations into the indexing process

let me remind you of that famous place in dickins
pickwick papers where we hear of a researcher who
composed a copious review on chinese metaphysics with
the aid only of the encyclopedia britannica which
contained absolutely no information on that subject
the technique used we are told with a nudge of
superiority was to read for metaphysics under the
letter m and for china under the letter c and to
combine the information
i feel that we may be performing just such a miracle
of creative juxtaposition when we assume that scientific
information is just some special variety of information
that contains queer words like potassium permanganate
pi r squared and numbers like 271828 we suppose too
that scientific libraries are just libraries that happen to be
full of scientific books and that the best possible
technical librarian would be somebody who had picked up a
library qualification and combined it with the appropriate
sort of technical qualification there is as they used to
say no mixture of ingredients but a genuine chemical
compound i wish to point out two simple facts there is
more to scholarship than the mere cumulation storage
and retrieval of information and there is about science
and technology something intrinsically different from
mere scholarship

elms experimental library management system is an experimental
system for total library management operating online with an ibm 360
through ibm 2260 and 2741 terminals the system is designed to handle
large amounts of highly variable information which it processes on
command giving online computer service for all library operations
at the same time it must accommodate the different needs and skills
of a broad range of library users from new patrons to welltrained
librarians
such a system presents programming problems that will be typical
of large interactive computer systems in the seventies this paper
discusses elms features that facilitate user interaction and may prove
useful in similar systems techniques for tutoring the user display

interactive systems in existence for nearly 15 years are becoming
increasingly important both for information retrieval and library support
operations the virtues of these systems are speed intimacy and 
if timesharing is involved  economy the major problems are the cost of
the large computers and files necessary for bibliographic data the still
high cost of communications and the generally poor design of the user
system interfaces the desirable features of online retrieval interfaces
are only now being defined and tested in a systematic way eg by the
national library of medicine in its aimtwx nationwide experimental
retrieval service system implementers must in addition to engineering
the right capabilities into online systems also make a careful
concerted effort to engineer user acceptance common pitfalls here
include overselling system capabilities and failure to take into account
the social context around the user terminal the major national problem
is to avoid or limit wasteful and expensive duplication in providing
nationwide search access to the hundreds of public and private data
bases that will be readily available during the next few years we do
not need technological breakthroughs to exploit the potential of
online systems but we do need breakthroughs in organizing for

a variety of aspects related to testing of retrieval systems were
examined a model of a retrieval system together with a set of measures
and a methodology for performance testing were developed in the main
experiment the effect on performance of the following variables
was tested sources of indexing indexing languages coding schemes
question analyses search strategies and formats of output in
addition a series of separate experiments was carried out to investigate
the problems of controls in experimentation with ir systems the main
conclusions the human factor appears to be the main variable in all
components of an ir system length of indexes affects performance
considerably more than indexing languages question analyses and search
strategies to affect performance to a great extent  as much if not more
than indexing retrieval systems seem to be able to perform at present only
on a general level failing to be at the same time comprehensive and specific
it seems that testing of total ir systems controlling and monitoring all
factors environmental and systemsrelated is not possible at present

though the idea of constructing a keyword classification for retrieval
purposes automatically is not a new one comparatively few systematic
experiments have been carried out in this area and while many suggestions
have been put forward not enough is known about the behaviour of automatic
keyword classifications and hence about the properties such classifications
should have and the ways they should be used in previous experiments we
showed that some forms of classification could give good results and this
paper describes a further series of tests designed to examine this sort of
classification in more detail with a view to establishing the optimum forms
of classification and procedures for using them in different retrieval
situations these tests demonstrate that further improvements in
performance over that for unclassified keywords can be obtained and that
definite conclusions can be drawn about the correct approach to classification
for collections like the test one the best results are given when grouping
is confined to strongly connected nonfrequent keywords when the
classification is used to provide additional rather than alternative indexing
terms particularly for requests and when matching is controlled by keyword
frequency

compound words cause some difficulty in postcoordinate indexing
systems if too many are fractured or the wrong categories are selected
for fracturing noise will be produced at unacceptable levels on retrieval
various prior suggestions for handling compound terms are examined which
include those for precoordinated or rotated indexes
the syntactic origins are also explored and it is found that many
compound words hinge on a prepositional relationship between the components
and that this relationship can be applied to decision making other
compound words are in effect abbreviated statements from longer phrases
while some are influenced by the presence of a verblike form
these syntactic influences together with some of the philosophy from
earlier studies  especially that of the force required to fracture a
term have been combined to produce a set of rules which have been
employed at the national rubber producers research association nrpra
for over two years these have greatly eased decision making and have
enabled the thesaural vocabulary to be made more consistent
it is also suggested that the rules have some bearing on the
application of roles especially if these are employed on a precoordinate
basis

previous research has indicated that the titles rather than index terms
would in the standard medlars system gave lower recall but higher precision
a title searching technique is described which allows the number of references
retrieved to be fixed before a search commences with this technique the
greater applicability of titleterms offsets their relative paucity the
titlesearching technique is tested using queries put to medlars these
queries were not specially solicited for the test title searching is compared
with the standard medlars index term search and with an index term search with
fixed output size for equal output sizes title searching retrieves 4
relevant references for every 5 retrieved by index term searching thus the
relative retrieval efficiency of title and index terms is so close that the
choice of one method or the other must be primarily on economic grounds

this article focuses on the human interaction characteristics of an
information retrieval system suggests some design considerations to
improve manmachine cooperation and describes a research system at
stanford that is exploring some of these techniques
librarians can only be of limited assistance in helping the naive
user formulate an unstructured feeling in his mind into an appropriate
search query that maps into the retrieval system consequently the
process of query formulation by the user interactively with the
information available in te system remains one of the principal
problems in information retrieval today
in an attempt to solve this problem by improving the interface
communication between man and the computer we have pursued the
objective of displaying hierarchically structured index trees on a crt
in a decision tree format permitting the user merely to point with a
light pen at alternatives which seem most appropriate to him using
his passive rather than his active vocabulary expands his interaction
vocabulary by at least an order of magnitude moreover a
hierarchically displayed index is a modified thesaurus and may be
augmented by adding lateral links to provide semantic assistance to
the user a hierarchical structure was chosen because it seems to
replicate the structure of cognitive thought processes most closely
thus allowing the simplest most direct transfer of the mans problem
into the structure and vocabulary of the system

a new testing process is described designed to compare conventional retrieval
medlars and automatic text analysis methods smart the results obtained
with a collection of documents chosen independently of either smart or medlars
indicate that a simple automatic extraction of keywords from document abstracts
produces a 30 to 40 percent loss compared with medlars indexing a replacement
of the unranked boolean searches used in medlars by the standard ranked output
normally provided by smart reduces the loss to between 15 and 20 percent when
automatically generated word control list or a thesaurus is used as part of the
smart analysis the results are comparable in effectiveness to those obtained
by the intellectual medlars indexing finally the incorporation of user
feedback procedures into smart furnishes an improvement over the normal medlars
output of 15 to 30 percent
one concludes again that no technical justification exists for maintaining
controlled manual indexing in operational retrieval environments

a semantic differential sd is a commonly used instrument which can
be used to reliably measure attitude toward a variety of objects or
concepts each sd consists of a series of bipolar adjective scales on
which a respondent reacts in relation to the object or concept of interest
to interpret completed sds it simplifies the procedures and aids in the
development of theory if the adjective scales are grouped into one or more
independent clusters the primary purpose of this study was to identify
those clusters or dimensions applied by a user of an online useroriented
reference retrieval system when he reacts toward such a system
seventyone who used or were familiar with a working online reference
retrieval system completed a packet of 20 sds each consisting of the same
19 adjective scales the correlations among the scales were factor
analyzed three independent dimensions were identified factor i was
labeled evaluativespecific and accounted for over 23 of the total
variance factor ii was called desirability it accounted for over
17 of the total variance and factor iii entitled enormity accounted
for over 10 of the total variance another analysis showed the factor
structure to be highly reliable therefore if the derived three
dimensional structure underlies users attitudes toward a more general
class of retrieval systems then undimensional or unstructured system
evaluation of users attitudes will be simplistic and possibly misleading
in order to construct a working semantic differential 10 adjective
scales were identified which best represented the three dimensions
brief instructions are included which outline how to use this sd
the discussion is mainly concerned with the obtained factor structure

articles in the basic pool were cited a total of 2545 times during this
fouryear period 19671970 the figures concerning citation rate by
year serve to uphold the idea that journal citation reaches a peak during

this paper develops a mathematical model for use in studying how to
minimize the cost of operating a mechanized retrieval system through
the use of cost analysis the model provides a method for comparative
evaluation between information retrieval systems the cost model divides the
costs of a retrieval system into two components system costs and user costs
in addition it suggests that a trade off exists between the performance
level of the system and the combination of user and systems time that is
expended in working with the system this minimizes the total cost of
operating the system the allocation is done for a given performance level
and for a given cost per unit of user and system time

a taxonomy for modeling information systems is presented the taxonomy
derives from the history of modern epistemology epistemology is used as a
prescriptive modeling basis because 1 the fundamental problems of
epistemology are concerned with information and 2 because the history of
epistemology identifies any archetypal ways that men have conceived of
information and of models
it is shown how the different models of epistemology can be made
scientifically operational through the use of a special kind of systems
analysis
finally the results of a preliminary experiment based on one of the models
are presented in the form of prescriptive rules for the design of future
experiments

the use of a medical library by members of the faculty of a medical school
was studied by questionnaire in an effort to ascertain the part the library
played among channels of communication in workrelated information searches
the study described the population of users and the kinds of sources
they utilized in an information search in an effort to identify the factors
influencing their choice of kinds of sources and leading to the possibility of
predicting use of kinds of source once the characteristics of the users were
known it brought out a high use of sources which are accessible and easy
to use the tabulations show the importance of coworkers in informal
communication low delegation of documentation tasks to libraries was
apparent the main user of the library studied was a clinician in the area of
internal medicine who used journal articles about diseases for information to
use in the treatment of his patients the recommendations were made that
journals should be shelved accessibly with index medicus nearby books
might be shelved less accessibly telephone access to the library is of
major importance as is the provision of adequate photocopying facilities

it is argued that a users subjective evaluation of the personal
utility of a retrieval systems output to him if it could be properly
quantified would be a nearideal measure of retrieval effectiveness
a hypothetical methodology is presented for measuring this utility by
means of an elicitation procedure because the hypothetical methodology
is impractical compromise methods are outlined and their underlying
simplifying assumptions are discussed the more plausible the simplifying
assumptions on which a performance measure is based the better the measure
this along with evidence gleaned from validation experiments of a certain
kind is suggested as a criterion for selecting or deriving the best measure
of effectiveness to use under given test conditions

it was argued that the presentday thesaurusconstruction and maintenance
rules and conventions are not theoretically based for this reason there
are few rules and conventions for updating a thesaurus consequently
most of the thesauri adopted by operating information storage and
retrieval systems are not systematically updated in order to
investigate how thesauri are actually updated a survey was conducted
the working hypothesis was that the communication process between authors
and readers is linear in nature oneway communication allowing no
reciprocal feedback if a thesaurus utilized in a system is not updated
by both indexers and question negotiators findings show that thesauri
viewed from the communications point of view do not allow a cybernetic
process of communication bothway communication the survey
indicated that the present practice of updating thesauri is largely
done by indexers alone no attempt was made to develop a theory of
thesaurus construction and updating it was however argued that
such a theory if developed should at least account for the concepts
of meaning and knowledge within this theoretical framework two
techniques are suggested to be considered for the systematic updating
of a thesaurus

it has been suggested that information science is still of the stage
of alchemy if this is so then mutual exclusivity must form its
philosophers stone mutual exclusivity appears to be alien to the
observable universe that this is so is displayed through a series of
examples some of these relate to everyday things like trees beaches
and man himself whilst others relate to more obscure phenomena like
continental drift and black holes the act of observation is also
considered as this has a considerable bearing on the problem
nevertheless mutual exclusivity must form part of mans mental
powers and this has found expression in the relatively exclusive
series of symbols used in communication the dangers of exclusive
thinking in relation to environmental problems are considered and
this results in a paradox which is probably unresolvable finally it
is observed that outstanding genius appears to pay scant regard to
existing classifications and is more likely to be involved in an
integrated approach to problems

the philosophy of a systems approach to the design of information
storage and retrieval systems is suggested in which the computer is
recognized in its proper perspective as a powerful and effective
alternative tool this philosophy is in contrast to a prevalent
philosophy of the 60s in which many information systems designers
touted the computer as the answer to all information storage and
retrieval situations important principles of information system
design incorporated within the framework of the novel philosophy
for the 70s are presented these are the performance of users
needs studies by the representative small group technique the
analysis of users needs including their rank ordering by priority
the selection and adaptation for a specific application of a suitable
existent information storage and retrieval system from those available
the involvement of potential users in the system design by establishing
a model with which they can interact and provide feedback and the final
design of a costeffective system a number of pitfalls arising from
earlier design methodologies are pointed out and the avoidance of these
pitfalls by adopting a true systems approach is discussed

a new form of document coupling called cocitation is defined as the
frequency with which two documents are cited together the cocitation
frequency of two scientific papers can be determined by comparing lists
of citing documents in the science citation index and counting identical

scientific specialties and an example is drawn from the literature
of particle physics cocitation patterns are found to differ
significantly from bibliographic coupling patterns but to agree

it was argued in part i see jasis marchapril 1973 p 87 that the best
way to evaluate a retrieval system is in principle at least to elicit
subjective estimates of the systems utility to its users quantified in
terms of the numbers of utilities eg dollars they would have been willing
to give up in exchange for the privilege of using the system and a naive
methodology was outlined for evaluating retrieval systems on this basis
but the impracticality of the naive evaluation procedure as it stands raises
the questions how can one decide which practical measure is likely to
yield results most closely resembling those of the naive methodology and
how can one tell whether the resemblance is close enough to make applying
the measure worth while in the present paper two kinds of solution to
these problems are taken up the first answers the questions in terms
of the reasonableness of the simplifying assumptions needed to get from
the naive measure to the proposed substitute the second answers it by
experimentation

some new text searching retrieval techniques are described which retrieve
not documents but sentences from documents and sometimes on occasions
determined by the computer multisentence sequences since the goal of the
techniques is retrieval of answerproviding documents answerpassages are
retrieved an answerpassage is a passage which is either answerproviding
or answerindicative ie it permits inferring that the document
containing it is answerproviding in most cases answersentences ie
singlesentence answerpassages are retrieved this has great advantages
for screening retrieval output
two new automatic procedures for measuring closeness of relation
between clue words in a sentence are described one approximates
syntactic closeness by counting the number of intervening syntactic
joints roughly speaking prepositions conjunctions and punctuation
marks between successive clue words the other measure uses word
proximity in a new way the two measures perform about equally well
the computer uses enclosure and connector words for determining
when a multisentence passage should be retrieved however no procedure
was found in this study for retrieving multiparagraph answerpassages
which were the only answerpassages occurring in 6 of the papers
in a test of the techniques they failed to retrieve two
answerproviding documents 7 of those to be retrieved because of
one multiparagraph answerpassage and one complete failure
of clue word selection for the other answerproviding documents they
retrieved at all recall levels with greater precision than smart
which has produced the best previously reported recallprecision results
the retrieval questions mostly from real users and documents used in
this study were from the field of information science the results of the
study are surprisingly good for retrieval in such a soft science and
it is reasonable to hope that in less soft sciences and technologies
the techniques described will work even better on this basis a
dissemination and retrieval system of the near future is predicted

chens data for the raw frequency of use of 138 physics journals in the

usepermeter of shelf other units of size for obtaining densities
and their measurement are discussed there is no evidence for synchronous
obsolescence in the 1955 to 1968 volumes of these journals instead there is
some statistically significant evidence of greater density of use with
greater age similar evidence elsewhere is cited the ranking order for
heaviness of use is also radically altered by converting raw frequencies
to densities of use
it is suggested that for comparing the relative values of different

throughout my years of work as an information scientist i have been
plagued by a personal and professional sense of doubt with respect to the
field a central theme of every conference that i have attended related
to what is information science or is information science a science
in this paper i hope to take these questions head on i must begin by
saying that i do take information science seriously as a science i see
it as the quest for understanding of the nature of information and
mans interaction with it that we lack so much in this quest for
understanding is the greatest challenge of the science
i intend to explore the tradition or world view bearing on the
scientific study of information the currently prevalent world view is
the scientific tradition which extends from the enlightenment to
the present i also intend to look critically at what i perceive
to be te premises underlying most of our current efforts to understand
the phenomenon of information the criticism will by necessity be
speculative i intend to stick my neck out not because i can prove
my assertions but because i believe these ideas must be discussed

successful information retrieval from a mechanized file is heavily
dependent on the fidelity of the representation of concepts in the
particular language of the system and on the predictability of this
representation
if an index language is employed predictability is guaranteed and
the quality of the retrieval is predominantly governed by the fidelity
of the representation ie by the extent to which conceptual
distortion of the concepts to be represented can be avoided the various
index languages vary widely with respect to their fidelity differences
in their performance are correspondingly great
the lack of fidelity in most of the present day indexing languages
is due mainly to insufficient representation of the relationships
among concepts we describe a new graphical method of storing and
retrieving concept relations of various kinds the points of such a
graph are occupied by concepts and the connecting lines between these
points represent concept relations in a special field of chemistry
these graphs also serve as a kind of presentation of the essentials of a
document to the reader that is much more lucid than a natural language

a good deal of work has been done over the years in an attempt to use
statistical or probabilistic techniques as a basis of automatic indexing and
content analysis
unfortunately many of these methods are lacking in effectiveness and the
more refined procedures are computationally unattractive
a new technique known as discrimination value analysis ranks the text
words in accordance with how much they are able to discriminate the documents
of a collection from each other that is the value of a term depends on how
much the average separation between individual documents changes when the given
term is assigned for content identification the best words are those which
achieve the greatest separation
the discrimination value analysis is computationally simple and it assigns
a specific role in content analysis to single words juxtaposed words and
phrases and word groups or thesaurus categories experimental results are
given showing the effectiveness of the technique

the problem studied in this research is that of developing a set of
formal statistical rules for the purpose of identifying the keywords of
a documentwords likely to be useful as index terms for that document
the research was prompted by the observation made by a number of writers
that nonspecialty words words which possess little value for indexing
purposes tend to be distributed at random in a collection of documents
in contrast specialty words are not so distributed
in part i of the study a mixture of two poisson distributions is
examined in detail as a model of specialty word distribution and formulas
expressing the three parameters of the model in terms of empirical
frequency statistics are derived the fit of the model is tested on an
experimental document collection and found to be acceptable for the
purposes of the study a measure intended to identify specialty words
consistent with the 2poisson model is proposed and evaluated

with relevance as a key notion in information science is traced to the
problems of scientific communication relevance is considered as a measure of
the effectiveness of a contact between a source and a destination in a
communication process the different views of relevance that emerged are
interpreted and related within a framework of communication of knowledge
different views arose because relevance was considered at a number of different
points in the process of knowledge communication it is suggested that there

titlesubject information about it with sufficient accuracy to be able

color of the documents cover or its approximate length could this
type of nonstandard information be profitably exploited in computerized
catalogs of the future such facilities if available would surely be
used for according to catalog usage surveys a majority of todays
library patrons seek known documents and of these a substantial
minority possess nonstandard information in this report the results of

nonstandard information are described and analyzed a ranking according
to relative memorability and potential retrieval usefulness of various
nonstandard book features is given it is estimated that if the average
patrons nonstandard information were exploited by appropriate retrieval
strategies he would only have to search through roughly one fivehundredth
as many documents as in a random search this reduction factor is great
enough to make nonstandard information potentially useful in many

the effective transfer of technology involves more than just
distributing paper it demands that useful documents be disseminated with a
minimum of useless ones for 1 month 10 researchers recorded a sample of
the written technical information items that they received 4 months later
they were interviewed to determine which of these items had proved useful
and in what ways
the results indicate that 1 a researcher will call an item useful
even if it does not cause him to take some action but only has some
significance for him 2 the more the source of an item knows about the needs
of the researcher or the more the researcher knows about an item he seeks
the more likely it is that the researcher will find the item useful 3
no strong relationships were found between certain readily observable
physical arrangements and information behavior and 4 an item may prove
useful not because of the information objectively contained in that item
but because the item causes a cognitive restructuring of the researchers
mind or a free association
other studies that restrict their measures of information usefulness
to externally observable behavior or that do not carefully define usefulness
may not be validly representing usefulness to the researcher

make the abstract as informative as the document will permit so that
readers may decide whether they need to read the entire document state the
purpose methods results and conclusions presented in the document either
in that order or with initial emphasis on findings
make each abstract selfcontained but concise retain the basic information

this paper reports on a novel technique for literature indexing and
searching in a mechanized library system the notion of relevance is taken
as the key concept in the theory of information retrieval and a comparative
concept of relevance is explicated in terms of the theory of probability
the resulting technique called probabilistic indexing allows a computing
machine given a request for information to make a statistical inference
and derive a number called the relevance number for each document which
is a measure of the probability that the document will satisfy the given request
ranked according to their probable relevance
the paper goes on to show that whereas in a conventional library
system the crossreferencing see and see also is based solely on
the semantical closeness between index terms statistical measures of
closeness between index terms can be defined and computed thus given
an arbitrary request consisting of one or many index terms a machine
can elaborate on it to increase the probability of selecting relevant
documents that would not otherwise have been selected
finally the paper suggests an interpretation of the whole library
problem as one where the request is considered as a clue on the basis of
which the library system makes a concatenated statistical inference
in order to provide as an output an ordered list of those documents
which most probably satisfy the information needs of the user

the statistical approach to the analysis of document collections and
retrieval therefrom has proceeded along two main lines associative machine
searching and automatic classification the former approach has been
favored because of the tendency of people in the computer field to strive for
new methods of dealing with the literaturemethods which do not resemble those
of traditional libraries but automatic classification study also has been
thriving some of the reasons for this are discussed
the crucial question of the quality of automatic classification is treated
at considerable length and empirical data are introduced to support the
hypothesis that classification quality improves as more information about
each document is used for input to the classification program six
nonjudgmental criteria are used in testing the hypothesis for 100
keyword lists each list representing a document for a series of computer
runs in which the number of words per document is increased progressively
from 12 to 36 four of the six criteria indicate the hypothesis holds and
two point to no effect previous work of this kind has been confined to the
range of one through eight words per document
finally the future of automatic classification and some of the practical
problems to be faced are outlined

this inquiry examines a technique for automatically classifying indexing
documents according to their subject content the task in essence is to have
a computing machine read a document and on the basis of the occurrence of
selected clue words decide to which of many subject categories the document in
question belongs this paper describes the design execution and evaluation of
a modest experimental study aimed at testing empirically one statistical
technique for automatic indexing

this study reports the results of a series of experiments in the techniques
of automatic document classification two different classification schedules
are compared along with two methods of automatically classifying documents into
categories it is concluded that while there is no significant difference in
the predictive efficiency between the bayesian and the factor score methods
automatic document classification is enhanced by the use of a
factoranalyticallyderived classification schedule approximately 55 percent
of the documents were automatically and correctly classified

the retrieval of documented information is one of todays most widespread
technical problems affecting almost every large professional group
corporation and government bureau because document retrieval is in part an
information processing problem much hope for a solution has vested in
computers but large fast reliable ones have been around now for five year
and people have steadily realized that the overall task of information
retrieval is not one of those rote jobs for which digital computers are made to
order cataloging and searching are intellectual tasks and have been thought
of as rote not because they are menial and straightforward but because they
are unpalatable and unwanted many people do like to use their minds yes 
but not for plowing through and discarding irrelevant material
many people have assumed that this would also be the case in information
retrieval accordingly the rush to put computers to work in this area has led
primarily to their use as searching instruments and much activity has centered
around the design and operation of searching machinery boundary conditions
have been assumed such as an ideal searcher who knows what he wants and who
knows how to express it in terms understood by the machine and such as ideal
correspondence of descriptors to the documents they describe then attention
has been focused on optimizing the processes between these boundaries the
resulting theories and systems in most cases seem highly adapted to the needs
of machine but not adapted to the needs of humans
we are after all dealing with the elemental situation of an author talking
to a reader  even if by means of a buffer storage which will grow more and
more mechanical the basic problem is to increase the mental contact between
the reader and the information store so that the reader can proceed unerringly
and swiftly to identify and receive the message he is looking for

such phrases as information flow may be purely metaphorical or may refer to
porterage and storage of physical documents transmission of signals power
required for signaling shannons selective information changes in the state of
ones personal knowledge propagation of announcements concerning messages
social increase of awareness propagation of or reaction to imperatives and so
on these matters are distinct and must be distinguished then conditions must
be stated under which one can validly speak of and measure the appropriate flow
in this paper it is shown that within the field of notification mention and
delivery of recorded messages to users there are twenty basic activities formed
by choosing triads from the six variables message code channel source
destination and designation
flow has meaning only when two such triads have two variables in common
forming a tetrad then flow or correspondence between any pair of variables is
inextricable from a conjugate flow or correspondence between the other pair
between any pair of endpoints there are six possibly distinct types of flow
according to which two of the remaining four variables are directly used to
achieve the flow

this paper describes new methods of automatically extracting documents for
screening purposes ie the computer selection of sentences having the
greatest possible potential for conveying to the reader the substance of
the document while previous work has focused on one component of sentence
significance namely the presence of highfrequency content words key words
the methods described here also treat three additional components pragmatic
words cue words title and heading words and structural indicators sentence
location
the research has resulted in an operating system and a research methodology
the extracting system is parameterized to control and vary the influence of
the above four components the research methodology includes procedures for
the compilation of the required dictionaries the setting of the control
parameters and the comparative evaluation of the automatic extracts with
manually produced extracts the results indicate that the three newly proposed
components dominate the frequency component in the production of better
extracts

many methods for the coding of chemical structures
have been described in the literature some methods code
the compound only partially typical of these are the
methods using descriptor codes other methods among
which the socalled ciphers are prominent code
compounds exhaustively all these methods require
cerebral effort that is a chemist is needed who must
have learned the rules of the code and who must known how
to dismember correctly each structure to be coded a
disadvantage of code designations of structures is furthermore
that they are not generally understood by chemists no
advantages accrue to the chemist from knowing how to
generate and how to interpret a chemical code codes are
needed only for the mechanical manipulation of chemical
structures clearly then if the coding of chemical compounds
could be accomplished automatically this automatic conversion would
relieve the chemist of considerable burden

and unambiguous method of representing chemical
structures by a linear series of letters numbers
ampersands and hyphens these symbols are meaningful to
chemists familiar with the notation and can be processed
by automatic data processing adp equipment
the uniqueness of the linenotation permits the use
of alphanumerically arranged lists of notations for

recording chemical structure information for storage and
subsequent retrieval we believed that current methods
and the then current development of notation systems
would not completely serve our chemists long range
chemical identification needs
accordingly we studied and then developed a chemical

review of the various approaches and applications to use
his terminology our system is topological coding

as part of the development of a computerbased
chemical information system at cas it has been necessary
to devise techniques for the registration of drawings of
chemical structures a major purpose of the cas registration
process is to determine whether a particular structure has
already been stored in the system the ability to make
this determination makes it possible to utilize a computer
to assign to every chemical structure a unique identifying
label this identifying label referred to as a registry
number is the thread that ties together all information
associated with a particular compound throughout the
developing cas computer system it is because of this
association made possible by the registration process that
cas will be able to provide multiplefile correlative searches
with assurance that all information on file for a particular
compound has been located

this paper describes and specifies the rules for generating a code to
represent chemical formulas it may be used either as a notation or for
internal manipulation by computer for registration screening and atomby
atom search it is basically a connection table in a concise format which also
contains abnormality information relating to specific atoms or relations
between atoms the notation produced by these rules unambiguously defines
a structure as a connection table but the notation is unique only to a
given numbering or citation order of the atoms hence its uniqueness is
dependent on the numbering uniqueness of the atoms in the structural formula
techniques for the use of the code in registry and substructure search are
also discussed

volume of the ninth collective period 19721976 and subsequent volumes of
chemical abstracts while remaining generally within the framework of iupac
and other existing nomenclature rules the most systematic recommended names
have been chosen these names are more easily derived from molecular structural
diagrams and therefore are more quickly found by index users machine
editing of index names and translation of these names into structural
representations in the cas computerbased information system are also aided
by the revisions the index name revisions include i conversion of almost all
trivial or author terminology into more systematic names ii simplification

a computeroperated storage and retrieval system for chemical structures
based on the use of the iupac notation has been in operation at shell
research limited sittingbourne kent england since 1965 involving a
file of nearly 50000 compounds use of the iupac cipher has proved
advantageous as regards speed and cost of both input and searching for
most searches scanning of the information explicit in the cipher has proved
adequate our computer programs also enable conversion of ciphers into atom
connection tables and generation of fragmentation codes the integrated use
of these facilities and their merits relative to other approaches are discussed

there are many chemical retrieval systems which
process the first type of request efficiently most of these
systems are also capable of handling certain fragment
requests however the fragments which can be processed
are frequently of a restricted nature for example in
retrieval systems which are based on linear ciphers only
those fragments which are explicit in the cipher are
readily detected to allow a completely general
specification of fragments it seems inevitable that a
detailed atombyatom comparison is required of the query
and library structures a technique for making such detailed
comparisons is presented in this report this technique
is novel in that it avoids the excessive backtracking ad
restarting required by other atombyatom matching
procedures
before giving the details of the proposed algorithm
some definitions are reviewed and a brief example is
presented to illustrate the overall concepts then the flow
diagram of the algorithm is explained in terms of additional
examples finally the mechanization of the algorithm for
a digital computer is discussed
this report is a condensed version of the original which
gives a generalization and comprehensive description of
the algorithm proofs of convergence and related topics
and applications other than chemical retrieval systems

the chemical abstracts service cas chemical registry system is a computer
based system that uniquely identifies chemical substances on the basis of
composition and structure since initial operation in 1964 as a standalone
input storage and retrieval system for structural representations of organic
chemical compounds the scope of the cas registry system has steadily increased
to include all types of chemical substances and the entire system has been
integrated into cas indexing operations the third refinement of this system
registry iii which has been in operation for over a year involves major
changes in registry recods but no change in the basic algorithmic techniques
for registering chemical substances the previous format for listing atoms
and bonds has been modified so that each ring system is now separately
identified and this ringsystem identifier is used in the record for each
substance that contains that ring these modifications support cas nomenclature
derivation and also a computerbased structure output system the general
design of registry iii which involves a structure record of cyclic and acyclic

emphasize the effects of computer speed on composition storage searching

scientist chemist toward the learning process and the role of the literature
in that learning process the acs has gained some insight into this behavior
and thus urges caution before one leaps to the uncritical conclusion that
the literature as now constituted is dead but has not yet fallen over what
seems more likely when human behavior patterns are considered is that the
new and the old will coexist side by side for several generations and that
the systems current emphasis on completeness will be replaced with selective

place during and since world war ii for purposes of
comparison the work of patterson and sheppard is
represented in abbreviated form in tables 1 and 2 the
results of our own study are presented as tables 3 and 4
the reader can draw several obvious conclusions about
half of all the citations in tables 3 and 4 are to papers
published in the 1950s this in part reflects the
present highly vigorous state of chemical investigation
and its rapid expansion in recent years another striking
fact is that in the journal of the american chemical
society 395 of the citations are to previous work
published in the journal itself in industrial and
engineering chemistry the percentage of self citations
is 213 to some extent this may result from the fact
that writers who habitually publish in a particular
journal tend to cite their own work however it seems
to reflect to a greater degree the dominance of these
journals in their respective fields more than 38
of the citations in industrial and engineering chemistry
are to various american chemical society publications
in the journal of the american chemical society more than

which one can view a data base as being large it can be
large in terms of having a large number of entries or
records or bibliographic references it can be large in
the sense of having a large number of fields or data
elements which implies a degree of complexity it can be
thought of as large in the sense of having a large number
of searchable or selectable elements and it also can be
large in the most readily understandable sense of having
a large number of characters in storage

the increasing availability of computerreadable files of chemical
nomenclature and of programs for text searching has led to the development
of methods for performing substructure searches in which ca nomenclature
terms are used as search terms substructure searches on ca index
nomenclature can often result in very high recall relative to topological
searches as is shown by experimental results achieved on a variety of
searches many data bases which contain ca index nomenclature also contain
nonsubstance data thus searching of substance and nonsubstance data
can often be done within a single search of a file with both high recall
and relevancy profile construction aids prepared by cas make it possible
for persons without sophisticated nomenclature backgrounds to construct
nomenclature profiles for many questions

a basic idea suggested in this paper is that a linguistic hedge such as very
more or less much essentially slightly etc may be viewed as an operator
which acts on the fuzzy set representing the meaning of its operand for
example in the case of the composite term very tall man the operator very acts
on the fuzzy meaning of the term tall man
to represent a hedge as an operator it is convenient to define several
elementary operations on fuzzy sets from which more complicated operations may
be built up by combination or composition in this way an approximate
representation for a hedge can be expressed in terms of such operations as
complementation intersection concentration dilation contrast
intensification fuzzification accentuation etc
two categories of hedges are considered in the case of hedges of type i
eg very much more or less slightly etc the hedge can be approximated
by an operator acting on a single fuzzy set in the case of hedges of type ii
eg technically essentially practically etc the effect of the hedge is
more complicated requiring a description of the manner in which the components
of its operand are modified if in addition the characterization of a hedge
requires a consideration of a metric or proximity relation in the space of its
operand then the hedge is said to be of type ip or iip depending on whether it
falls into category i or ii
the approach is illustrated by constructing operator representations for
several relatively simple hedges such as very more or less much slightly
etc more complicated hedges whose effect is strongly contextdependent
require the use of a fuzzyalgorithmic mode of characterization which is more
qualitative in nature than the approach described in the present paper

rj x ajt  constant  5x6
where rj is the citation factor for the year j and ajt stands for the
total number of articles that have appeared up to and including year j
this citation law is based on the remarkable fact that in more than 150
years the mean number of relevant citations per article per year has remained
constant viz 2x8 in spite of the fact that after 1950 three times as many
articles have been published as in the period before 1950

any statistical regularities found in documentation should be fully

distribution it requires data on only the most productive journals is
mathematically simple and amenable to graphical methods if a proposed idea of
the completeness of a search is accepted for comparability of results
certain conditions which include a specified minimum level of productivity of
journals need to be standardized a standard form is suggested
it is found however that a modified form of the bradford distribution is
required when bradfordtype collections of journals are merged into large

it is now ten years since some slight experimental evidence was presented

relationship between recall and precision the idea of this was certainly not
new fairthorne had more than implied it in his discussions on obna and
abno systems ie onlybutnotall high precision and allbutnot
only high recall however it was one of the propositions arising from
cranfield i which met with strong opposition and was quite rightly attacked
in reply to the critical review by swanson i had to agree that the
simple hypothesis required modification by the following year test results
coming from the experiments by salton and from cranfield ii made
further modification necessary and the hypothesis was finally put forward
to read as follows within a single system assuming that a sequence of
subsearches for a particular question is made in the logical order of expected
decreasing precision and the requirements are those stated in the question
there is an inverse relationship between recall and precision if the results
of a number of different searches are averaged this it will be noted has

many retrieval experiments are intended to discover ways of improving
performance taking the results obtained with some particular technique as a
baseline the fact that substantial alterations to a system often have little
or no effect on particular collections is puzzling this may be due to the
initially poor separation of relevant and nonrelevant documents the paper
presents a procedure for characterizing this separation for the collection
which can be used to show whether proposed modifications of the base system are
likely to be useful

this paper examines the implications of the findings of evaluative tests
regarding the retrieval performance of natural language in various subject
fields it suggests parallel investigations into the structure of natural
language with particular reference to terminology as used in the different
branches of basic science the criteria for defining the terminological
consistency of a subject are formulated and a measure suggested for
determining the degree of terminological consistency
the terminological and information structures of specific disciplines such
as chemistry physics botany zoology and geology the circumstances in
which terms originate and the efforts made by the international scientific
community to standardize the terminology in their respective disciplines 
are examined in detail this investigation shows why and how an artificially
created scientific language finds it impossible to keep pace with current
developments and thus points to the source of natural language

in a 1973 paper sengupta analysed references to biochemical journals in an
attempt to provide a guide for librarians with a limited budget he not only
ranked journals by the absolute number of citations made to 1969 volumes but
related the number of citations to the number of papers and even to the number
of words in each journal as perhaps a better guide to selection of journals
for subscription than position in the ranking list a similar procedure is
adopted in two more recent articles by sengupta on physiology and microbiology
journals

lists of journals ranked according to number of citations received are
frequently used as indicators of usefulness but little research has been
carried out to test the validity of this hypothesis on comparing lists of
titles of journals ranked by citation counting with lists of the same journals
ranked according to frequency of use using data from a survey at the national
lending library it was found that the rank order correlation between the two
was low this suggestions that ranked lists produced by analyses of citations
do not constitute valid guides for journal selection by libraries

a classification is a theory of the structure of knowledge from a
discussion of the nature of truth it is held that scientific knowledge is the
only knowledge which can be regarded as true the method of induction from
empirical data is therefore applied to the construction of a classification
items of knowledge are divided into uniquely definable terms called isolates
and the relations between them called operators it is shown that only four
basic operators exist expressing appurtenance equivalence reaction and
causation using symbols for these operators all subjects can be analysed in a
linear form called an analet with the addition of the permissible permutations
of such analets formed according to simple rules alphabetical arrangement of
the first terms provides a complete logical subject index examples are given
and possible difficulties are considered a classification can then be
constructed by selection of deductive relations arranged in hierarchical form
the nature of possible classifications is discussed it is claimed that such an
inductively constructed classification is the only true representation of the
structure of knowledge and that these principles provide a simple technique
for accurately and fully indexing and classifying any given set of data with
complete flexibility

it was first observed by bradford that for a large collection of journal
references on a given subject most of the articles are derived from a small
proportion of the total titles bradford listed the journals concerned in order
of decreasing productivity and by plotting the logarithms of the cumulative
totals of titles against the cumulative totals of relevant articles produced
he obtained a straight line similar results have been obtained by many later
workers the pattern is illustrated by table i which shows the distribution
of references among journal titles obtained by the author during a study of
literature usage in the petroleum industry on the basis of these results
bradford then formulated a simple mathematical model to describe reference
scattering vickery later pointed out that this law of scattering predicted
not a straight line but a curve kendall has now provided a more refined
statistical explanation of the straight line observed by bradford

the foreignlanguage barrier facing british scientists is a function of a
the amount and value of foreign scientific literature produced b the
linguistic ability of the people wishing to read it and c the availability
and effectiveness of translation services to obtain quantitative data on
these points the nll has recently conducted a survey amongst scientists and
librarians in the united kingdom and the present paper presents the more
important results
the survey has shown that the language problem is of considerable magnitude
and is common to the majority of scientists and technologists the languages
creating the most difficulty are russian german and japanese it has also
indicated that local translation facilities are not particularly effective and
that as far as national facilities are concerned british scientists are
largely unaware of existing services which might help them to overcome their
difficulties
the results of the investigation suggest a number of lines of action which
the appropriate authorities might follow the most important would seem to be
the publishing of a international index to translations and the creation within
the united kingdom of a centralized japanese translation service

words have no precision though in information storage and retrieval we are
required to act as if they did we have therefore to impose certain
arbitrary conditions to reduce the element of personal interpretation
meaning must be remove from the indexing stage to that of vocabulary
construction vocabularies can be reduced to a minimum first to a core of
terms used in specialist science and following russel ultimately to
undefined terms symbolic of sense experience basic english has shown
similar minimizing to be feasible for a natural language the success of

the purpose of this project was to identify variables thought to affect
relevance judgements and conduct a series of laboratory studies to determine
the effects of these variables on relevance judgements this paper discusses
the variable of implicit use orientations  the particular attitude taken by
a subject judge about the intended use of a document one hundred and forty
judges rated each of nine abstracts for relevance to several short information
requirement statements the some judges then repeated the ratings each
adopting assuming one of the fourteen use orientations described to them it
was found that the particular use orientation assumed by the judge has a marked
effect on relevance judgements it was also found that implicit use
orientations can be analysed in terms of their underlying structure and that
their study offers the possibility of discovering the conditions under which
one person can accurately simulate and use the implicit use orientations of
another
relevance judgements have been used as a basis of measures designed to
evaluate the effectiveness of information retrieval system this judgements
have usually been accepted at face value and have not been subjected to
critical scrutiny there is reason to believe however that as ordinarily
obtained they may be unreliable and sensitive to a number of conditions of
measurement that have not been carefully controlled in previous evaluation
studies

the term obsolescence occurs frequently in the literature of librarianship
and information science in numerous papers we are told how most published
literature becomes obsolete within a measurable time and that an item receives
half the uses it will ever receive halflife in a few years obsolescence
is however very rarely defined and its validity interest and practical value
are often assumed rather than explained before reviewing studies on
obsolescence therefore it is necessary to look at the concept and to
identify the reasons why it should be of interest

informationuse studies are vitally necessary in order to complement
challenge and sharpen informed intuitive judgements but even the
broadest conclusions drawn from such studies need to be examined critically
the conclusions or their generality may sometimes be invalidated by special
conditions in the survey sample by the environment having been disturbed
by the survey by the interpretation given to questions or observations or
by the way the data has been analyzed these same factors make direct
comparison of results from different surveys difficult and make superficial
comparisons misleading some comparisons and conclusions are certainly much
less sound than the casual reader might suppose particularly when results
have been compressed and taken out of their context in the original survey

the coverage overlap and indexing of abstracts journals were described
briefly these were carried out by selecting recent comprehensive
bibliographies on specific subjects searching the appropriate abstracts
journals via the author indexes to determine the number of references given
in the bibliography that were abstracted then consulting the subject
indexes to try to locate those references which are known to have been
abstracted a further eight bibliographies have been studied and the
results are reported here
our results are presented below in the following form
1 title of bibliography source content number of journal references
reports etc
2 abstracts journals consulted
3 coverage and multiple coverage this is a barchart showing number of
references not abstracted those covered once twice and so on

i would suggest three possible reasons for the constant average number of
references per article firstly on average articles more than fifteen years
old rarely get cited as they are rendered obsolete by the rate of advance the
net increase per annum of citeable articles is not as large as might otherwise
be expected
secondly many relatively small specialized subject areas each tending to
have its own literature and internal citation practices are hiving off from
the classical areas because of the specialized nature of modern science
thirdly it seems that the building blocks of an article can on average
be adequately specified regardless of the volume of published information
by reference to about eleven items of the prior art relating to the main
theme associated concepts and methods and general background

extension of the 2x2 table also the statistical relationships between
parameters are allimportant it is considered that precision is not such a
useful measure of performance in conjunction with recall as fallout a more

periodicals carried out at the national lending library during a period of four
weeks in 1968
threequarters of the requests came from universities and industrial
organizations and over 90 of the requests were for english language
publications over a fifth of the requests were for seventeen titles there
were marked variations in the subject matter requested by different types of
organizations and although the overall halflife of the literature proved to
be 3 12 years this figure varied considerably from one subject to another
concerning the sources of references it was discovered that compared with
scientists and technologists social scientists make relatively little use of
abstracting and indexing publications
appendixes include a copy of the questionnaire used in the survey a list of
title requested six or more times and a list of abstracting and indexing
publications cited five or more times as sources of references

in this field the law cited is usually that named after bradford or
zipf according to whether the interest is in vocabulary or periodical
literature or physical access in the rate of diminishing returns or in the
cumulative yield from a given input the behaviour is hyperbolic that is
the product of fixed powers of the variables is constant this type of
behaviour has been observed for a century or so in fields ranging from
meteorology to economics and has given rise to many particular explanations
appropriate to the particular fields thus it has received many names

evidence provided by the dainton report indicates that special libraries in
the uk are far from fully exploiting the photocopying services provided by the
national libraries as these photocopying services are legally obliged to
operate at cost they offer significant economies to any special library which
exploits them systematically
this paper describes a simple graphical method of estimating the savings
that can be made or the extended subject coverage that can be obtained at no
additional cost by substituting photocopies for relevant papers in the
peripheral periodicals relating to any welldefined scientific or technical
subject
though photocopying charges must be realistic the confident exploitation of
the national photocopying services depends on the avoidance of arbitrary jumps in
photocopying charges

the expression halflife borrowed from physics has appeared
quite frequently in the literature on documentation since 1960 when an
article by burton and kebler on the halflife of some scientific and technical
literatures was published although it had certainly been used previously
burton and kebler point out that literature becomes obsolescent rather than
disintegrating as in its original meaning so that halflife means half the
active life and this is commonly understood as meaning the time during
which onehalf of the currently active literature was published numerous
studies have been carried out mainly by the analysis of citations to establish
obsolescence rates of the literature of different subjects bourne points out
that different studies have given widely different results so that many of the
halflife figures reported are not valid beyond the particular sample of
literature or users surveyed certainly they cannot be used as accurate
measures for discriminating between different subjectfields

thirty years or more ago a favoured question in examination papers
for librarians was some variation on the theme compare the merits of a
classified catalogue and an alphabetical subject catalogue this was a
subject which it was possible to write on or to discuss at great length
advancing a number of theoretical arguments or opinions expressed by pundits
without ever stating a single demonstratable fact when in the early 1950s
various people such as taube and mooers proposed new techniques for
indexing the reaction from the traditionallyminded was such that it
appeared there was to be a repetition of all the old arguments in an
editorial in american documentation in 1955 perry expressed a viewpoint
shared by many others when he wrote

cautious and searching evaluation of all experimental results is
essential in rating the efficiency of documentation systems may
the ageold controversies that arose from the conventional concepts
of classification not be reborn in the mechanized searching systems
of the future there is hope for the avoidance of such errors if
we will but regard documentation systems as useful devices the
benefits of which must be determined not by polemics but by the
intelligent measurement of such benefits in relation to needs and
costs the machines of the future can make us free but only if we
are willing to subject them and ourselves to the most rigid
intellectual discipline

classification is so fundamental and pervasive an activity that care
is needed to define its scope when discussing a particular application such
as information retrieval
retrieval from an information store a library of those items relevant
to a request involves locating a particular class describing what we think
we want and then if necessary adjusting this class  broadening it to find
more material or narrowing it if the initial response proves excessive this
implies recognition of the relations between the classes and the whole
operation is often referred to neatly as locating and relating assuming
that we examine only a limited set of documents those most likely to be
relevant the operation is entirely one of classification  the recognition of
particular classes and their relations the fact that the instrument we use to
assist this operation may display quasiclassificatory features eg
alphabetical sequence or may consist largely of our own brain box and memory
store should not hide this otherwise obvious fact

a description is given of the english electric thesaurofacet a faceted
classification and thesaurus covering engineering and related scientific
technical and management subjects a novel feature of the system is the
integration of the classification schedules and thesaurus each term appears
both in the thesaurus and in the schedules in the schedules the term is
displayed in the most appropriate facet and hierarchy the thesaurus supplements
this information by indicating alternative hierarchies and other relationships
which cut across the classified arrangement the thesaurus also controls word
forms and synonyms and acts as the alphabetical index to the class numbers
the resulting tool is multipurpose as easily applicable to shelf arrangement
and conventional classified card catalogues as to coordinate indexing and
computerized retrieval systems the reasons are given for modifying certain
traditional facet techniques including the choice of traditional disciplines
for main classes the lack of a builtin preferred order and the use in
certain instances of enumeration rather than synthesis to express multiterm
concepts methods of application of the thesaurofacet in precoordinate and
postcoordinate systems are discussed and brief account is given of the

success or failure of the search was correlated to degree of correctness and
completeness of the searchers information about title and author of the item
that he wished to locate factors involved in searching strategies were
discussed the double role played by both the title and the author as a way of
access to the catalogue and as a means for identifying the right entry was

the feasibility is examined of devising a scheme for operating a joint
keyword system in a given subject area using several independently compiled
thesauri it is suggested that if the individual keywords of each
participating thesaurus represent indentifiable concepts and these concepts are
given unique code numbers then the code numbers enable the keywords of any
participating thesaurus to be converted into the appropriate keywords of any
other participant incompatibilities between keywords systems arise from
differences in the selection and form of keywords eleven types of
incompatibility are identified and a method of reconciliation is proposed for
each the types of incompatibility that can arise in a single language include
those that arise between one language and another so that a multilingual joint
system presents no additional problems

the term informatics was first advanced formally by the director
of viniti ai mikhailov and his colleagues ai chernyi and rs
gilyarevskii in their paper informatics  new name for the theory of scientific
information published at the end of 1966 an english translation was
circularized in the beginning of 1967 as the authors state in this paper
they are not the first to use this term and they quote a review by professor
jg dorfmann of their own book fundamentals of scientific information in
which dorfmann criticizes the use of other terminology such as documentation
documentalistics information science and so on
their definition is as stated above but they are careful to add the rider that
informatics does not investigate the specific content of scientific information
only the structure and properties in their paper they also advance definitions
for information scientific information scientific information activity

proposal by changing the title of their own book for its second edition and
the title of the information science fascicule of the referativnyi zhurnal

the performance of a retrieval system with a file of only a few hundred
references can be measured by assessing the relevance of each reference to each
of a number of queries a suitable measure of retrieval performance is then the
recall ratio  the fraction of the relevant references that are retrieved by the
system when the file is large this method of measuring performance is not
practicable and recall cannot be measured although it can be estimated a
number of estimation procedures are examined and found unsatisfactory another
measure of retrieval performance is the extension ratio which is approximately
the ratio of the quantity of known relevant references before and after putting
a query to the retrieval system the properties of this measure are examined
and it is applied to 315 medlars searches

one technique for searching a coordinate index is to compare each reference
with a boolean expression of index terms this divides the file into retrieved
and notretrieved references an alternative is to assign each reference score
calculated from its index terms and to retrieve the n highest scoring
references in the file this scoring technique has several advantages in
theory and it performed slightly better in a retrieval test with n equal to
the number of references retrieved by the corresponding boolean search in the
test a minimum value of n  10 was used and when less then this number of
references matched the boolean search requirement the scoring technique
successfully widened the score of the search and retrieved twice as many
relevant references as the boolean searches

this paper is concerned with the availability of books known to be held by
the library it outlines a simple survey method whereby readers record the
nonavailability of books which they are looking for the survey has already
been installed at four university libraries but the results from only one
library are considered here these results show how a librarian can find out
the degree of nonavailability or failure in any particular area of the library
the causes of failure and even the particular items which are in heavy demand
and not available
they also provide information on the degree of cooperation by the readers
the number of titles failing once twice three times etc the overlap of
demand for popular books by different groups of borrowers the waiting time for
books that failed the pattern of demand for particular books over a period of
time the relationship between failure and recall the correlation of failure
from one term to the next and the relative use of books inside and outside the
library
from the results it was possible to recommend certain changes in library
procedure which should have reduced failure and to compare the titles of books
failing in the main library with the holdings of a departmental library the
time spent on the survey and the total cost of the survey are also given

the exhaustivity of document descriptions and the specificity of index terms
are usually regarded as independent it is suggested that specificity should be
interpreted statistically as a function of term use rather than of term
meaning the effect on retrieval of variations in term specificity are
examined experiments with three test collections showing in particular that
frequentlyoccurring terms are required for good overall performance it is
argued that terms should be weighted according to collection frequency so that
matches on less frequent more specific terms are of greater value than matches
on frequent terms results for the test collections show that considerable
improvements in performance are obtained with this very simple procedure

this paper continues the reporting of the units work on a method of
investigating how often readers fail to find what they are looking for on the
shelves why they fail and what particular books they fail to find
the method used is a slight modification of the earlier one  readers were
asked to record on a slip provided the details of the book or periodical they
were looking for or subject area they were looking in their academic status
and the date and then to place the slip in an adjoining box fron analysis of
these failure slips it was possible to determine the cause of the readers
failure the individual book the reader was looking for and the pattern of
failure for different groups of volumes
a new development was surveys of samples of readers carried out during the
fortnight of peak demand answers to these surveys provided information on the
effect or failure on a readers work what action he took after failing whether
he found adequate substitutes how many books he found by browsing and what
proportion of the books he consulted he borrowed some of these answers could be
checked by a direct count of the books used in and borrowed from the library
the investigations were carried out in three university libraries each with
its own characteristic library structure and teaching patterns these
differences were reflected in the results obtained
it is hoped that the methods of investigation used can be employed by
librarians to investigate the effectiveness of some of the services in their own
libraries

explicit commitment to users needs however mystical this concept may
be requires the librarian to examine users behaviour as a first step

document analysis is here understood in following sense the extraction
of meaning of documents  in the present case written documents we could
define the latter without reference to the usual distinction between scientific
literature the object of document analysis in information science and other
kinds of texts  historical records myths folklore sacred writings etc
indeed one of my theses in that there is little hope of understanding the kind
of intellectual operations involved in the analysis of scientific documents or
questions pertaining to them other than through a study of textual analysis in
general as carried out in many disciplines  history sociology cultural
anthropology exegesis etc gardin 1969 for the purpose of this
presentation however i shall concentrate on the handling of scientific
documents in the first narrower sense and only refer to other categories of
texts in so far as they have been submitted to analytical processes of a
comparable nature

a selective dissemination of information service based on computer scanning
of nuclear science abstracts tapes has operated at harwell since october 1968
users interest profiles are constructed using euratom index terms and nsa
subject categories assigned to each item in nsa
the performance of the mechanized sdi service has been compared with that of
the preexisting current awareness service which is based on visual scanning of
journals and reports by information staff the visual service was found to be
providing an important service of good currency and high precision about 85
to a limited number of users the mechanized service is less selective and of
lower precision approximately 50 but can be expanded more readily
in order to compare the effectiveness of euratom index terms and words on
titles for computer sdi matching an experiment was set up in which sixty
users of the mechanized service assessed nsa document notifications which were
generated by matching either index terms and subject categories or words in
titles and subject categories without being aware of the method of matching
over 10000 document assessments fron six issues of nsa were returned the
average precision was 456 for index terms and 473 for title words index
terms retrieved more documents in the ratio 1131 but both systems missed
many relevant documents retrieved by the other index terms retrieved only 58
of the relevant documents selected by titles the converse ratio was 51
no significant effects of document types or subject on the relative
effectiveness of two matching systems were found but when the results were
analyzed by title length it appeared that for titles longer than about 100
characters title words gave recall equal to that of index terms though with a
lower precision
a detailed study of samples of items found by visual scanning but missed by
computer matching or found by one computer method but not by the other was made

the ideas and techniques of physics have been systematically applied to the
study of living matter since the 1950s and 1960s as a result a rapid and
large increase has taken place in the research activity in this field and
biophysics and molecular biology have emerged as important areas of study the
consequent enormous growth of literature in the field has created great
difficulties in tracking out the significant literature of the subject to
cope with this unprecedented growth of literature a ranking list of periodicals
in this field has been prepared on the basis of citations in the annual review
of biochemistry for 1968 1969 and 1970 this list is expected to reflect the
impact of literature on the progress of biochemical knowledge more accurately
than the list prepared by henkle in 1938 the present list brings out the
predominant position of biochemical research in the total scientific effort
today and the increasing bias of cognate disciplines towards biochemical
methodologies a method of analysis of the number of citations in relation to
size of the journal concerned and average length of the papers published has been
developed and applied in this study the analysis yields three parameters which
should be useful in assessing the actual scientific interest of a journal in
relation to the number of paper published compactness of the information
content and the scientific value of the paper in relation to compactness of
presentation
the results of the present study have been discussed in relation to
bradfords law of scattering and an extension of the law has been suggested
namely that during phases of rapid and vigorous growth of knowledge in a
scientific disciplines articles of interest to that discipline appear in
increasing numbers in periodicals distant from that field it is expected that
the present ranking list will enable librarians and other professional workers
in the field of biochemistry to select journals from the viewpoint of their
significance to the active areas or present day biochemical research

in the course of the survey covered by this paper cost data were collected
by visiting eighteen operational computerbased systems in europe and the usa
using a structured cost analysis scheme the sample included database
producers and selfcontained systems that both create and provide services
from a data base
from the data obtained unit costs have been derived for most operations
and the factors contributing to variations in the figures are discussed
analysis of the data has shown that costs are affected more significantly by
factors such as system management salary variations and productivity of staff
than by technical factors such as depth of indexing data preparation methods
or computer programming
the total operating budgets of most of the systems have also been analysed to
show the overall pattern of cost distribution including overheads

concern with quantitative assessment of libraries and their services this
concern is both the result of and a reaction to growing pressures from
within and without the library profession to adopt the tools of the
management sciences the pressures are generated by many factors including
the success of these tools in other fields and their adoption by the
organizations supporting libraries the increasingly explicit character

before starting to trace the development of precis to its
theoretical beginnings i shall describe the system briefly in its present
form this will serve not only as an introduction for those who are not
familiar with the system but will also help to explain the relevance of
some of the historical sections which follow in which we shall see how a
machineproduced alphabetical indexing system based on a syntax derived
from a study of natural language developed out of research into
principles for a new general classification
precis or the preserved context indexing system differs in some
respects from traditional alphabetical indexes and lists of subject headings
like the system developed by coates for the british technology index
precis consists essentially of a set of working procedures not a prescribed
list of terms or phrases the system is firmly based upon the concept of an
openended vocabulary which means that terms can be admitted into the
index at any time as soon as they have been encountered in literature
once a term has been admitted its relationships with other terms are
handled in two different ways distinguished as the syntactical and the
semantic sides of the system

while fairthorne may not have been the first person to recognize it
certainly for this author fairthorne was the first to make explicit the
fundamental problems of information retrieval systems namely the clash
between obna and abno onlybutnotall and allbutnotonly
although it was not until 1958 that the terms occur in fairthornes
writings the concept had been discussed in many meetings of the agard
documentation panel and elsewhere originally it was considered that to meet
these two requirements it might be necessary to have two separate systems
and the test of the uniterm system in 1954 was based on the hypothesis
that a marshalling system eg udc was fundamentally different from
a retrieval system eg uniterm while the idea persisted in this form
for some time it gradually evolved into the inverse relationship of recall
and precision which is to say that while it is possible to obtain of the
relevant documents allbutnotonly or alternatively to obtain onlybut
notall it is not possible to obtain all and only

the proposition is examined that largescale photocopying such as that
practised by the british library lending division affects the sales of
journals there is little evidence of a reduction in journal circulation
figures in spite of large increases in journal prices which have risen much
faster in terms of cost per page than the retail price index university
libraries have since the nllst was established devoted an increasingly high
proportion of their budgets to journals though recent financial pressures are
now forcing cancellation an extensive survey of demand for journals at blld
shows a heavy concentration on a relatively small number of titles most of them
well established journals widely held by libraries and with large
circulations the demand for inprint issues of the average journal is small
it is concluded in the absence of any evidence to the contrary that economic
difficulties experienced by journals publishers and the increased demand on the
blld are unrelated though both owe something to the economic pressures on
libraries

in traditional classification schemes the universe of knowledge is broken down
into selfcontained disciplines which are further analysed to the point at which
a particular concept is decated this leads to problems of
a currency keeping the scheme in line with new discoveries
b hospitality allowing room for insertion of new subjects
c crossclassification a concept may be considered in such a way that it
fits as logically into one discipline as another
machine retrieval is also hampered by the fact that any individual concept is
notated differently depending on where in the scheme it appears
the approach now considered is from an organized universe of concepts every
concept being set down only once in an appropriate vocabulary where it acquires
the notation which identifies it wherever it is used it has been found that
all the concepts present in any compound subject can be handled as though they
belong to one of two basic concept types using either entitles or attributes
in classing these concepts are identified and notation is selected from
appropriate schedules subjects are then built according to formal rules the
final class number incorporating operators which convey the fundamental
relationships between concepts
fron this viewpoint the rules and operators of the proposed system can be
seen as the grammar of an ir language and the schedules of entitles and
attributes as its vocabulary

a simple model of a twostage hierarchical library system is described the
model indicates in terms of user costs and library viability how the
branch library should be stocked the most significant factor used in the
analysis is shown to be the ratio of the two actual user costs rather than the
actual costs themselves it is shown that the viability level of stock
provision of the branch library is determined by this ratio

a brief review of the principal work study techniques is given it is
suggested that these techniques are applicable to libraries and librarians and
will become increasingly useful as the problems of increased work loads become
more severe data concerning standard times and performances would be useful
for system design and planning providing such data is put in its proper
context and particularly if it is used to improve effectiveness as well as
efficiency

the kinds of information needed by managing librarians to make correct
decisions are considered with emphasis on the value of current data on the
exceptional situation management information in a library is of greatest use
in comparison either internally or with data from other libraries a simple
standard method of recording and costing is urged so that librarians may
readily identify procedures requiring improvement
development of the present costing method is traced from its original state
as a simple management information system based on exception reporting ie
reporting the exceptions which occur in any particular survey through a pilot
study in a large university library to its full installation in two further
university libraries the method of analyzing the raw data is described and
examples of the tables are given together with brief background information on
the libraries concerned
after a note on the limitations of the present costing method and of unit
costs in general unit times and costs are given for numerous operations in
both the libraries surveyed covering both reader and technical services there
is agreement between results of several american studies and those of the
present investigation for further comparison the information on times and
salaries has been used in conjunction with a standard civil service costing
procedure

between 1969 and 1971 bath university library experimented with a personalized
information service to social science researchers at the universities of bath
and bristol the principal service offered was a manual current awareness
service based mainly on the scanning of primary and abstracting journals
the service was evaluated by feedback slips returned by clients for each
reference notified and by a questionnaire at the end of the experiment the
relevance performance was good and few references had been seen before some
precision could have been sacrificed to ensure comprehensive recall the whole
service was rated highly by nearly all users and considered to be a high
priority among the various possible claims on university resources those
who had the closest contact with the information officers had the best
scores on most aspects evaluated and rated the service most highly some
general observations on the place and value of an information service in a

this paper presents an experimental study of indexterm frequency as a factor
in retrieval performance the frequency of an index term or its breadth as
it is called here is the number of postings made to the term in a given
collection the question is asked of index terms assigned to documents which
function most effectively in retrieval the most term or popular terms or those
which are used relatively infrequently the experiment is a retrieval experiment
and uses the cranfieldsalton data breadth of indexing is varied by
nonrandomly deleting terms from documents retrieval output is evaluated using
the expected search length measure of retrieval effectiveness as well as the
usual precision and recall the wilcoxen test is used to determine the
statistical significance of the different indexings the results show that the
optimal breadth of indexing is a variable depending on user needs if a few
documents are wanted or high precision is desired then narrow terms are more
effective than broad ones if on the other hand all or most relevant documents
are wanted then broad terms are better an argument however can be made for
the quality of narrow terms since when these terms are deleted precision never
improves whereas deleting broad terms always results in a higher precision a
corollary experiment is carried out to compare two indexings of the same
average breadth where one indexing consists of
semantically appropriate terms  terms taken from the document title  and the
other consists of merely reasonable index terms the result suggest that
titleterm indexing is qualifiedly superior

weighting formulae probabilistic measures of effectiveness and management
theory to be woven into a coherent pattern benefits of the theory are the
beginnings of a quantitative description of retrieval languages a clear

retrieval performance can be tailored to suit individual needs in a systematic

level of required skills and competencies  often new  has brought about
an urgent need for improved training beyond the first professional
degree at the postmasters level the basic purpose of this research is
curriculum development at the postmasters level that will equip the
middle and upperlevel personnel in libraries for the changes confronting
them although it would be possible to restructure the masters program
and add the courses that this study shows a need for that alternative
has not been pursued for two reasons a fairly stable masters curriculum

first it is no longer enough to simply provide for the retrieval
of complete bibliographic items as a unit but rather one tends more and
more to request informational details that may be contained in the book
second modern knowledge has become too complex and interdependent that it is
no longer possible to provide a single welldefined category for the books or
journal articles

the intense development of science and its immediate application in production
is one of the characteristic feelings of our time the growth of the economy
now depends more and more on the speed of scientific research
one of the main tasks of the fiveyear plan 19711975 is to develop in every
possible way basic and applied scientific research and to rapidly introduce their
results into the national economy
the directives of the 24th congress of the cpsu emphasize the need to improve
scientifictechnical information and to guarantee the systematic transfer to
interested fields and institutions of information on scientific achievements
and progressive experimentation in the areas of technology the organization of
production and production management

this volume presents the results of a detailed study of the
place of foreign language materials in university research
in the course of our investigation we accumulated a large
amount of data on the use of published information and of
library services by research workers and academic staff our
analyses have necessarily been limited by the specific aims of
the project but we have been constantly aware that there are
many other possible analyses of the same material for this
reason we have endeavoured to include in the appendix as much
of this raw data as possible and to provide in the text itself
when presenting our own analyses as much detail as possible of
the methodology and other background information necessary for
any full evaluation

at one time or another many authors must have faced the dilemma of
whether to gather their articles published on a certain topic and republish
them as a collection of essays or whether to rework them into an entirely
new book i decided in favor of the first course with regard to the articles
i had written during the last fifteen years on language and information
in particular on the more technical and applied aspects leaving for some
future occasion my papers on the philosophy of language

the three chapters of this book are somewhat elaborated versions of
three lectures the beckman lectures that i delivered at the university
of california at berkeley in january 1967 the first is an attempt to
evaluate past contributions to the study of mind that have been been based
on research and speculation regarding the nature of language the second is
devoted to contemporary developments in linguistics that have a bearing on
the study of the mind the third is a highly speculative discussion of
directions that the study of language and mind might take in coming years
the three lectures then are concerned with the past the present and
the future

do you know that there are 3071 counties and parishes and 59 county
equivalents in the united states making a total of 3130
do you know that only 39 states have statutory provisions for county law
libraries
do you know that seven states have no listing for county law libraries in
the american association of law libraries 1968 directory of law libraries
do you know that los angeles county california not only has the largest
county law library collection in the united states but it also has seven
branch law libraries
these four questions readily point out the simple fact that the growth and
development of county law libraries in the united states has been uneven
without pattern or standards not only on a statetostate basis but on a
county tocounty basis within a particular state a survey of the 39 state
statutes relating to county law libraries reveals that there are no two states
that have exactly the same method for the establishment administration
financial support or maintenance of a county law library

one of the objectives of a library catalog is to enable one to determine
what books or publications by an author are in the library establishment
of special rules of entry for serial publications which preclude attribution of
authorship defeats this objective the present rule 6 of the angloamerican
cataloging rules are the paris principles are criticized in this regard in the
course of this criticism it is shown that the presence of a generic title the
presence of the name of a corporate body within the serial publication are not
valid criteria for determining authorship of a serial publication furthermore
using the form of publication produces unpredictable entries for serials
therefore it is proposed that special rules for entry of serials be abolished
that a serial be treated like any other work of corporate or personal authorship
including compilations and works produced under editorial direction this will
have the added benefit of allowing consistent treatment of instances of
corporate and personal authorship

since the advent of periodical literature in the seventeenth
century well over ten thousand journals have been published in
the field of biomedicine many of these have ceased publication
others are only of local interest still approximately two
thousand desirable periodicals in this field are being currently
released as research and discovery are recorded in the journal
literature the greatest asset of a scientific library is its
subscription list and periodical holdings it therefore becomes
a major responsibility of such libraries to make this wealth of
experimental data available to their readers when funds are
limited the selection of a periodical collection that will best
serve the most urgent needs of the reader becomes of paramount
importance a plan of highly selective purchasing must be adopted
to prevent the improper use of funds actual needs of the library
must be at hand to carry out such a plan

this book libraries at large is itself one tangible outcome of advisory
commission activity representing the combined efforts of duke university
the rr bowker company members of the commission and its several study
groups and many other diverse individuals within and without the library
world the resultant theme is the same one that characterized the work of
our commission from the beginning  namely a concern that every individual
in our society be provided with library and informational services adequate
to his current and emerging needs confronting this goal requires a
recognition of inevitable change and we have questioned status quo
recognizing at the same time the differing pace and character requisite
for the implementation of designs in the adaptability to change the

historical resources in other languages which few united states students read
notably the handbuch der bibliothekswissenschaft edited by fritz milkau and

plain that the goodly company of works available did not meet all fundamental
needs the most nearly comprehensive treatment was elmer c johnsons a
history of libraries in the western world scarecrow 1965 which remains in
its second edition scarecrow 1970 solid and attractive reading but continues
as announced to cover only libraries its attention to librarianship is very
limited numerous important theorists are not even mentioned furthermore
the predominant organization by type of library hampers the analysis of
crosscurrents between libraries and life and thought particularly the
development of the image of the library and librarian the aim here has been
to tie it all together
in the present offering the west is used conventionally european
civilization with its near eastern ancestors and its western hemisphere
progeny the limitation is practical to try to cover even the west may
prove to be too much for one person to go beyond would be rash yet an

it has been suggested by various librarians concerned with innercity
service that the library serve as an informational and interpersonal link
between community residents and social agencies the major question is
whether it is necessary to add another agency to the already overburdened
social service bureaucracy the rationale for envisioning the library in
this role is twofold 1 the library has achieved a reputation for
impartiality because it provides information on all sides of an issue and
is not committed to any particular action program community service or
clientele and 2 librarians are specifically trained to locate organize
update and disseminate information

from time to time in the course of its historical development a
professional activity enters a new stage this usually takes place as the
culmination of a series of modifications to the practice of the art arising
out of changes in the social situation in which the profession operates
skilled workers sensitive to changing needs alter or refine their practice
so that it develops in tune with the progress of society itself descriptive
accounts of new or improved methods appear in the literature and from
time to time a leading thinker makes a new synthesis by combining these
explanations into a system or theory which gives a rational account
of what is going on and so prepares the way forward

although catalogue codes and standards have received much attention there
has been very little fundamental questioning of cataloguing principles and
practice basic questions in need of investigation include whether individual
libraries need catalogues of their own stock how far printed bibliographies
could serve as a substitute the functions catalogues are serving at present
and the actual demands placed on them the nature of users and nonusers and
the possible conflicts between the catalogue needs of librarians and
nonlibrarians the psychological factors of approachability and usability
whether standardization should overrule local needs whether catalogues
should be designed for use by readers at all the functions of printed national
catalogues the implications of increased cooperation and of the changing
functions of libraries what a catalogue entry should contain and how it
should be arranged and the possible administrative uses of catalogue data

of the systems approach an overview of the technology available to
the library and a projection of the prospects for library automation
there is a concern in every library for the proper handling and
control of a veritable flood of material and for the prompt and
convenient fulfillment of service demands that concern is matched by
excitement about the possibilities for effective use of the computers
and communications network in many library functions knowledge

combinations of electronic data processing machines and appropriate
programs and operating procedures organized to work together in
carrying out with a minimum of human intervention some welldefined
library process it is a field that many thoughtful observers feel
has reached a certain maturity and so deserves to have its portrait

of the success achieved by the paris international
conference on cataloguing principles 1961 in the
matter of the principles and general rules for entry
and heading taking under consideration the study of
bibliographical data in national bibliography entries
prepared by michael gorman the experts of
the copenhagen meeting set up a working group with
jack wells as chairman charged with drafting an
international standard bibliographic description for
monographic publications there was common
agreement that the objective was the development of
specifications for the necessary data elements their
order of presentation and the punctuation to delimit
them these specifications should be designed to
satisfy the needs of national bibliographies and
with whatever judicious trimming might be desirable
the needs of the libraries of the entire world it was
further agreed that these bibliographic descriptions
were to be made quite independently of the heading
under which they might appear in listings the working
group succeeded in its task and brought forth its
provisional isbdm in 1971 the first standard
edition was published earlier this year the success of
this standard is manifested by the continuing increase

social structures have changed more quickly during
the last one hundred years than during any other equivalent
period in history with these changes have come alternations
in the role of institutions of higher education during
the centennial year we shall try to measure the need and
nature of further change and to evolve ideas that may
influence its direction

in keeping with this idea the graduate school of library science
of the university of illinois felt that this indeed was a time propitious
for holding an international conference on education for librarianship
the profession as a whole and library education in particular are still
quite young but in less than one hundred years we have seen revolutionary
changes demands have been made on the worlds libraries and in turn on
the schools training personnel for these libraries almost too rapidly
for them to satisfy it seemed logical for library education therefore

it would add greatly to the usefulness of our reference libraries if an
agreement should be made to lend books to each other for short periods of time
it happens not unfrequently that some book is called for by a reader or that
in looking up the answer to a question a librarian has occasion to use a book
which he finds in the catalogue of another library but which does not belong
to his own collection the book very likely is one that can be replaced
if lost but it would take time to get it through ordinary channels it might
be necessary to send abroad for a copy or to wait to pick up one if the book
is scarce in such a case it would be a great convenience to be able to
borrow a book for a few days

when scholars and persons of high social position come to a library
they have confidence enough in regard to the cordiality of their reception
to make known their wishes without timidity or reserve
modest men in the humbler walks of life and welltrained boys and girls
need encouragement before they become ready to say freely what they want
a hearty reception by a sympathizing friend and the recognition of some one
at hand who will listen to inquiries even although he may consider them
unimportant make it easy for such persons to ask questions and put them at

that the steady stream of papers on the subject began in 1938 she reported 21

cabinets and which was to be expanded a survey of catalog user opinion
was undertaken to determine if some division of the catalog should be
considered some revision of the filing would be needed anyway because of
inconsistencies which had crept in largely involving the interfiling
of subject and title entries the following questions were asked of all users
of the catalog during hours selected at random over several weeks
1 are you looking for a particular book or for books on a particular subject
were you looking under author title or subject
2 what is your greatest difficulty in using the catalog
3 how would you feel about having the subject cards in a separate file
one hundred persons approximately one tenth of the campus population were
questioned 93 per cent felt that they would prefer having subject cards in a
separate catalog 5 per cent were opposed and 2 per cent undecided it must
be admitted that the prejudice of the person asking may have influenced the
way in which the question was answered  a similar survey made in 1954 by the
university of toronto showed general support for the dictionary catalog

that the american spirit includes a firm resolution to change whatever
is inefficient or corrupt otherwise 1776 would have no meaning the

the american urban public library is in something of a dilemma relatively
secure in the affections of the populace the library is nevertheless
frequently threatened by loss of income the threats are cyclical and are
associated with the local tax picture which at the present time is notably
obscure the abortive attempts earlier this year to reduce appropriations for
the libraries in newark and new york received widespread attention both because
the libraries are quite visible nationally and because the proposed cuts were
preposterously unmistakable in the eye of the politician who must find that
tiny bit of safe water between the shoals of economy and those of service the
library appears to be expendable ballast to be dumped in heavy weather in 12
years in two city libraries i have seen almost every budget year produce a
critical fight to prevent disaster from overtaking the library i think the
experience is not uncommon only the most extraordinary efforts keep most
urban libraries from going under libraries seldom thrive they survive

richest nation in the world during this era of extraordinary national economic
success the paradox invites some critical selfanalysis

the deadliest disease afflicting the library press is proliferation the
kindest and most conservative estimate i am able to bring myself to make is
that there are at least three times as many library periodicals in this country
as we can afford or are necessary perhaps the most constructive single thing
that could be accomplished would be to persuade at least one in three
publishers of a library periodical to cease publication
one might reasonably expect that librarians who have done so much
public wailing about the publication explosion would be among the chief
advocates and practitioners of birth control in the world of print instead
we find them cavorting as uninhibitedly in the kingsize bed of printed
procreation as do the denizens of the sodom and gomorrah of science and
technology just about every library of any consequence and some of little
consequence and almost without exception every group or organization
within the loose boundaries of our profession decides virtually at the
moment of its birth that it cannot survive without a publication of its
own  a newsletter a journal some regular calling card to announce its
presence to the world at large

a major and largely justifiable criticism of library education has always
been that it is too closely tied to present practices and that it trains
for current service instead of educating for growth and change unfortunately
the picture many faculty members have of what todays
requirements for public library service are tends to be obsolete graduates
are thus doubly handicapped not only do we fail to educate we fail
even to provide realistic training at worst we perpetuate the past and
train people for tasks that are no longer central to the concerns of public
libraries library education like the public
library itself will have to accelerate the pace of change or risk the fate of
oblivion institutions that can move with the times and maintain a position
of relevance to contemporary affairs will survive others will wither
away disappear or be replaced by more responsive agencies there is no
shortage of prophets of doom for both the public library and for
graduate library education but there are plenty of signs of life yet in both
an article in the june 13 1968 issue of the reporter called dust gathers

unforgivably time has passed since the days when the librarys patron was
the local monarch and cost was no deterrent times passage has replaced the
monarch with taxpayers or stockholders and concurrently sensitivity to cost
has attained stellar importance the causes for being unaware of costs
may stem from a variety of reasons but they cannot in all fairness to the
profession belie an inability to perform the simple arithmetic of cost
accounting what is suspected is a lack of the few
simple ground rules and the logical operations that bind them together in
short  a recipe for cost accounting and analysis
in the following is outlined one such set of ground rules and their related
procedural requirements which have evolved and been applied with success
over the past few years it is stressed that since this set represents the
findings of one library it may not fully satisfy the specific requirements of
your own shop therefore feel free to adopt the ground rules to your immediate
requirements with regard to discipline it is pretty much summed up in the
six steps and five resource requirements which follow in addition to
identifying steps requirements and the mysterious ways of cost analysis
these ingredients are blended together in a manner which will be meaningful
for your internal operations and may be significant for your librarys future

practice if put into operation as planned by the library of congress
users of lc catalog cards will require retraining all reference librarians
will experience an immediate and continuing demand for explanation of the
new catalog cards to users those large public and research libraries with
computerbased systems will require costly modifications of computer programs
yet the isbd international standard bibliographic description is destined
to be implemented by the library of congress with the sanction of ala but
without even being considered by the recognized standards associations iso

the battle lines are being drawn for a great debate
over the emotionally and politically charged issue of how library
and information services are to be funded in the coming decades
most librarians will be on the side of conservatism and democracy
favoring the continuation of traditional modes of taxsupported public
library service with information freely available to all
as a matter of right information industry people publishers
government officials engineers and even perhaps authors will be
on the side of progress and profits advocating a new concept of
forprofit or pay libraries user charges and information as a salable

during the last two decades academic libraries in
parallel with their parent institutions experienced the
greatest period of growth and affluence that they have
ever known the watchword was more  more money
more books and journals more staff more space and
more technology many new research libraries were
created and those that already existed experienced
unprecedented growth although libraries got more of
everything during those years they still could not keep pace
with the growth of new fields of research new doctoral
programs and the increasing production of books and
journals two decades of affluence not only failed to help
solve the many problems that were brought on by
exponential growth  they exacerbated them

although the use of games in professional education has
become widespread only during the last decade the method has
been used in a number of fields for many hundreds of years
its origins have been traced to simple war games used in
military training when the real thing was either unavailable
or too dangerous in more recent times these games have
become more and more sophisticated and many now use large
electronic computers to handle the complex calculations involved
since 1956 when the first welldeveloped management game was
introduced the technique has spread rapidly into a
wide variety of disciplines and today it is used at all levels
of education from primary school classes to courses for experienced
men and women one of the main causes of this game explosion has been
the rapid development of sophisticated management techniques such
as simulation and mathematical modelling which have been made possible
by rapid advances in computer technology

the problem investigated by the research was the development
of standards for reading materials that would support the adult
new reader in the exercise of his newfound skill and build the habit
of regular use of the printed word bridging the gap between minimal
literacy skills and the reading habit was proposed as essential
to the purposes of the library program in helping the reader improve
has basic education skills increase his employability and develop
his potential as a citizen and gain personal satisfaction in his
many adult roles the nature of library materials best designed
for this end required study in depth the findings and conclusions
derived from the research project provide basic information about the
adult new reader and his reading criteria for analysis of reading
materials and a bibliography of materials these products of the
study constitute a series of reading selection and guidance aids for

the combination of computers and communications technology
is a development whose time has come for libraries in the us
and despite missteps and false starts inevitable in adapting
the new technology for its use libraries are now rapidly
expanding telecommunications networks to serve their need to
disseminate everexpanding amounts of information in more
effective ways
it makes a good deal of sense when one considers that the
librarys function is to parcel out information and that
information can be forwarded electronically as easily as it can
be mailed
in fact the logic of library networks is such that everyone
is hopping on the bandwagon  consultants systems analysts
state agencies and a growing list of manufacturers that includes
xerox and international business machines their initial efforts
are concentrated on what are basically bookkeeping tasks  in
particular the cataloging of new acquisitions the ohio college
library center for example provides its customers with entries
for their card catalog files and because oclc is the first and
most extensive of the networks its approach is being closely
copied by the others

according to a national hospital panel survey conducted by the american
hospital association in february 1970 4191 72 percent of the 5820
community hospitals in the united states operated a library this percentage
falls to 60 when only hospitals of less than 100bed capacity are considered

fulltime staff members were found in only 1054 25 percent in even
fewer 928 was there supervision of the library by a professional librarian
clearly there is a massive job to be done if these libraries are to perform
properly their functions of health education and patient care
by community hospital we mean the nonfederal shortterm hospital
providing general and selected special services the hospital located at some
distance from a large medical center and without teaching and research
programs such as a nursing school or internships though the librarians
of more sophisticated teaching institutions may well profit from the study

a wise german librarian has linked the library administrator
and the cataloger as working for the common aim of economy
in work and cost coupled with better utilization of a librarys
resources this aim he thinks is expressed in various kinds of
cooperative work of pooling interests and of setting standards
it is to be developed prudently he says with the objectives
setting limitations in such a way that more values will not be
destroyed than are created
this ideal he set out in a chapter entitled tasks for the
future there was a time and not so very far back when the
library administrator and the cataloger worked side by side in
the more immediate past however the two have become separated
so that their closer collaboration does need to be set down
as a task for the future the immediate future at that
many new problems of administration have served to busy the
administrator and most catalogers have had more work than
enough with the result that administrators have come to know
less and less of cataloging and catalogers have come to know
less and less about general library administration the situation
now is that the administrator will be forced to pay more
attention to cataloging because it has become a major problem

in spite of the great volume of material dealing with
departmental and collegiate libraries that has appeared in
library periodicals and books on university and college
library administration there has been relatively little original
thought on the subject and virtually no historical treatment to
provide an adequate background for solution of problems which
have their roots in a former generation most of the literature
has been either repetition of the old arguments for and against
this type of library organization or statements of how this or
that institution has faced its peculiar problems except for
contemporary accounts of early american scholars describing the
attempts to transplant the german seminar library to american
soil and reports on a few large university libraries there is no
account of the conditions which brought about and for many
years invigorated the departmental system an evaluation of
trends in the history of departmental libraries over the last
threequarters of a century should prove to be a valuable supplement
to other information in the hands of surveyors and administrators
who are interested in abolishing establishing continuing or

the increasing growth and complexities of research libraries are natural
consequences of the growth of knowledge and the increasing complexity of
knowledge librarians have tried to amass more and
more knowledge in the form of books for the benefit of the diverse interests of
their clienteles their success in this activity has been reflected in the
increasing difficulties of identifying satisfactorily what they have the
processes of cataloging classifying and related technical routines have
become increasingly complex and expensive the processes
are of such a nature that the cost for adding each new item to a large library
is on the average potentially if not actually higher than that for its
predecessor the total proportion of the budgets of large research libraries
that is spent for the processing of material as distinguished
from the costs of its purchase or its direct
servicing is now such as to give librarians pause for fear a day may come when
nearly all the money available to large libraries will be spent in processing
material and little will be left to service the collection or to buy new books

an industrial society has an open class stratification system it
offers some an opportunity to rise but it offers no guarantee against
downward social mobility compared to other types of societies this one
demands a wider variety of higher level skills and thus generates much
pressure against the forces that in all societies tend to keep the individual
in his original caste or class much of the resulting mobility is based on a
radical change which has taken place in the occupational structure of modern
industrial societies one which neither marx nor orthodox economists
anticipated an expansion of the demand for professional and technical skills
of a high order
thus not only are individuals competing with one another in their efforts to
rise in the class system but occupations too are engaged in the same
competition and may move up or down in power prestige or income

libraries find it increasingly necessary to use their limited resources in the
most efficient manner this requires the use of decision rules which permit
library resources to be directed to those activities which yield the highest
returns an effort is made to utilize part of welfare economics to suggest
which groups of library users will provide the greatest return to society
an evaluation of the traditional library functions of education information
and leisure suggests that libraries should direct their resources toward
educational activities and not toward recreation when public monies are
involved a case can be made for subsidizing the library activities of
schoolage children other explicitly involved in education disadvantages
minority groups and governmental officials and staff
since public and school libraries produce and distribute essentially the same
services it is an uneconomic use of the communities resources to maintain two
separate institutions one of which imposes costs on the other as children are
forced to use public library facilities due to school library inadequacies

1 the annual review which aims to provide a systematic record of the
contributions made within the previous year 2 the critical review which
selectively evaluates contributions to the solution of a common research problem
and 3 data compilations which are concerned with facts and findings rather
than the opinions of the authors of papers from which the data are taken the
role and control of the review article in medicine was described over the
past fifteen years the ratio of review to nonreview articles in medicine has
been on the order of 138 possible solutions to a number of problems associated

mathematical models of library operations are presented allowing managers to
estimate measures of effectiveness for a library these models describe the
amount of use made of resources by a user in a visit the distribution of book
circulation in a collection the dependence of circulation on time and the
effect of multiple copies on user satisfaction predictions are made on the
basis of the models of the consequence of breaking of central library into
branch libraries the effect in terms of frustrated use of removing the

it is rather surprising that behavioral scientists have not discovered
libraries much sooner in their search for institutional environments suited for
the testing of theoretical hypotheses librarians and their assistants respect
research and scholarship and are inclined to go far beyond the call of duty in
helping the investigator even when they are skeptical rightfully in most
instances of the usefulness of such research for the
improvement of their own organizations
data and related information are necessarily treated with greater precision and
discipline in libraries than in factories and most bureaucratic offices
therefore significant results can often be obtained
with smaller samples and in shorter periods
of observation people working in libraries do not feel they should curtail
disclosures about basic processes elsewhere professional employees are
obligated to preserve trade secrets from competitors
or to suppress facts which might be considered scandalous by legislative
committees at least as important to an investigator is the fact that one or
more libraries almost always lie close at hand  there could hardly be any
more convenient institution

an indexing or classification system should be judged by the retrieval
results it produces namely the extent to which it brings
forth relevant material and rejects the
irrelevant thus welldesigned experiments should permit judging the relative
merits of different classification schemes this notion although selfevident
had remarkably little impact on the field of
library science prior to the 1950s during that decade the first controlled
experiments on information retrieval were performed and these mark a turning
point in the history of classification research for the first time

challenges the right of the dictionary catalog to be the overwhelmingly
predominant type of catalog in libraries he questions its advocates claim
that it best meets a librarys needs he advocates a divided catalog such as
the one at amherst because for one thing the separate catalog
can more readily be used in conjunction with bibliographies in the subject
fields we find a similar argument in the latest item in the bibliography
harris 1957 fletchers article seems to have been followed by more
than thirty years of silence in the library journals on the subject
of the divided catalog during that period there were probably some
divisions of catalogs at some libraries but as thom qv indicates the

it was our original intention to include the cost of book selection with
the cost of ordering as part of the total acquisition process we also
attempted to get indirect costs such as rent and utilities very few of
the libraries were able to supply these figures so we based our survey on direct
cost only we found from the preliminary survey that book selection statistics
were extremely difficult to determine since all the professional staff in the
libraries concerned participated in book selection with the chief librarian
performing most of it as a result the cost of book selection was exceedingly
high and threw the cost of ordering out of proportion

they must derive the funds necessary for their operations and growth from

limited physical space expansion an administrative
consideration in every library becomes a stringent factor in the planning
of special libraries while public and college libraries may have
several decades of growth possibility when they take possession of a
building or area it is indeed a fortunate industrial library whose stacks are
not overcrowded after five years of establishment in new quarters industrial
floorspace is too greatly in demand to devote more effort to the
possible future growth of the library weeding or storage requirements
therefore are far more immediate considerations to the special industrial
library administrators than they are to administrators of other types of
libraries the limits of expansion are usually apparent earliest in the
serials collections of industrial libraries because so much current
technical data is published first in scientific and technical periodicals
these collections grow rapidly this summarization of a recent study made

as part of a design study to specify a regional processing
center for the new england state university libraries it was
required to know the percentage of collection overlap with respect to
each of the 30 ordered pairs of 6 libraries participating states were
maine new hampshire vermont massachusetts rhode island and
connecticut this overlap data was needed to predict the degree of
joint use of cataloging information and to estimate the efficiency of
collective reclassification
the results revealed a high degree of commonality in the 6 collections
showing for example that a random title from one library had
a 40 chance of being present in another randomly selected library
when current imprint samples were tested the figure rose to 47
rhode islands holdings were shown to be the collection of greatest

really summarize the findings of the study in one evening

academic libraries in their quest to secure and make available library
materials necessary to support instructional and research programs are finding
it necessary to rely upon librarians functioning as book selectors the term
bibliographer frequently applied to these selectors is gradually taken on
new meaning in library service the role of the bibliographer is changing to
include besides book selection new duties and responsibilities such as
advanced reference research work instruction and liaison duties between
teaching departments and the library in addition academic library
organization is gradually being affected by the increasing use of
bibliographers

the medlars medical literature analysis and retrieval system
system at the national library of medicine nlm has over
the past few years been one of the most significant and one of the most
publicized automated bibliographic information retrieval systems over
two hundred articles on it have appeared in american newspapers and
popular magazines in specialized medical journals throughout the world
and in a variety of library journals the publicity that has attended this
project has in a way been unfortunate for it has presented an
exaggerated picture of the system and its accomplishments which has only
made the sceptics more skeptical and it has obscured in part the
examination of medlars real accomplishments there has to date been very
little careful outside analysis and evaluation of medlars over 50
percent of all the articles listed in the bibliography in austins report
and virtually all the substantive ones represent the work of persons
closely connected with nlm or the development of the medlars
system their judgement on the effectiveness of the system and its overall
value cannot help but be colored by this connection

when we were asked in october 1969 for an expression of attitude
about a renewal of cataloginginsource our response was positive
we were interested and we were determined to make it succeed profiting
from the experience gained in the 195859 experiment we specified that
1 a survey of libraries be conducted
2 a survey of publishers be conducted
3 an expert investigator be secured
4 there must be adequate funding
5 there be adequate space and
6 that those factors be eliminated which represented the most

the measurement and evaluation of reference service
has been more often discussed than attempted in fact the
literature of this subject has itself spawned a fairsized
literature of review
admittedly the task is formidable as compared with
other library activities such as circulation acquisitions and
cataloging reference service is illdefined with little
agreement on its component parts is interlibrary lending an
integral part of reference work because many reference librarians
are responsible for it formal instruction in the use of books
and libraries the supervision of reference reading rooms the
preparation of indexes and having decided what the genus
reference librarian does how can one readily determine the
effectiveness of his work or its impact reference librarians
may have acted rather blindly in approaching their elephant of a

unmistakable signs are pointing the way toward
the creation sometime soon of a national information network
in the united states the concept of a national network implies
the interconnection of existing information systems and libraries
through communications certainly one of the great strengths of this
nation is the great array of intellectual scholarly and research
resources to be found in its libraries and information centers
without integration and close cooperation however these resources
will remain a series of separate insulated institutions but if
maximum communication can be established among them this array can
be converted into a national resource of immense value to citizens

theory and practice regarding patterns of decision
making in libraries have been relatively neglected aspects of
library administration yet the decisions by which a library
attempts to control its operations are of major importance to its
welfare and effectiveness recent theories in management and social
psychology have addressed themselves to the implications of
participative management and group decisionmaking and their findings
appear to have important applications to libraries not the least of
which is personnel development

it is only in the last eight or ten years that the
numerical aspects of bibliography have attracted attention although
some of the numerical regularities that occur in bibliography have been
known for thirty or forty years results are therefore still meager
and applications are still few moreover most of the work so far
reported has been limited to numerical analysis of the literature of the
natural sciences this is in part because the secondary sources in the
natural sciences are the best organized and so provide the most accessible
data in part because the literature of the natural sciences are the least
restricted by linguistic barriers and in part because the proposed world
wide systems such as those advocated in the unisist report offer an
immediate field of application in the design of economic and efficient
systems based on the results of numerical bibliographic analysis however
the field of possible application is gradually widening serious efforts are
now being made to organize the more diffused literatures of the social
sciences for example

the evaluation of reference service has received
considerable attention in the literature over a comparatively long
period but as samuel rothstein pointed out in his 1964 library trends
article on the measurement and evaluation of reference service much
of the literature has focused on discussing the lack of evaluation or
the shortcomings of the evaluation that has taken place in the ten years
since rothstein wrote his article there does seem to be more effort at
evaluation of reference service undoubtedly many of the trends in
recent evaluation are due to the influence of rothsteins article

inquiry one was the national sample survey of library use
made for the inquiry by the survey research center of the
university of michigan personal interviews of a halfhour
or more in length were held with 1151 people selected at
random in different counties scattered over the united states
the sample was designed so as to represent all adult persons
living in private households
by this tested method the survey gathered information
concerning the amount and the kind of use people make of the
public library and what changes or extension of library
service people in general would prefer the survey also
gathered information on the use of books obtained from sources
other than the public library as well as the extent of regular
use of newspapers radio magazines and movies

the concept of the core collection in a large library is not new the
thought behind such a concept is to provide a separation of the more
frequently used volumes from those that are infrequently used there
have been however difficulties in determining what volumes are to be
included within the core collection it is usually necessary to establish
a committee or group of professional people who determine usually by
enumeration those volumes that should be included in the core collection
often the results of such a determination merely reflect the opinions of
the individuals and although valid in many cases as desirable reading the
core collection that results may not be a reflection of user requirements

the traditional pattern of organization of national and university libraries
apart from those in germany or affected by german practice was imposed
by the weight given to the processing divisions the order department which
in university libraries did not include experts in bookselection was not
considered to be of comparable importance with the major department 
the cataloguing room which also housed the classifiers other divisions would
be concerned with particular types of material  maps state papers or
official documents manuscripts oriental books  and would be largely
autonomous with regard to acquisition and cataloguing the reading room staff
were mainly employed in assisting readers to use the catalogue and in
answering queries of a very specialized nature on the librarys collections
especially on manuscripts or early printed books they rarely dealt with the
general bibliographical or reference type of enquiry which is put to presentday
reference librarians in these circumstances members of staff tended to become
expert in the work of their own department and not be invited to take any part
in the activities of another divisions between the various
kinds of work were therefore hard and fast and the structure of the librarys
organization could become similarly rigid it must be appreciated that this
is a generalization and that many libraries were more fluid in their approach
nonetheless this conservative view of the librarys function tended to freeze
the administration into this form an expert in a particular subject field
often undertook research in the subject outside the library and might
occasionally be asked to deal with a reader enquiring about an aspect of his
field but usually he would not make much use of his expertise in connection
with his library duties unless of course he was appointed as a paleographer
orientalist or linguist
the appointment of subject specialists may therefore necessitate a complete
remodelling of the staff organization if their influence is to extend beyond
the bounds of the old departments

of the worlds numerous kinds of libraries the national and the university
may properly be characterized as having responsibilities for both general and
universal or nearly universal collecting in the realm of scholarship that is
these two and only these two commonly collect over a very broad spectrum
and in depth material which makes possible the creation of new knowledge
herein lies the paramount importance of these libraries to society if it be
granted as it is here assumed that almost no field of human endeavor can
advance without resort to the recorded past it is this twin aspect of the
activity of these scholarly libraries  collecting simultaneously in breadth
and in depth  which produces most of their major problems the concern of
this paper is with two of these problems which seem by far the most important
and difficult the selection of materials and the utilization of subject
specialists

reverberations of the publishing explosion of recent years are reaching us
now production of monographs and journals research reports and government
documents has been increasing exponentially to the point that british
university librarians are beginning to feel the sense of constriction of space
which their american counterparts have been struggling with for a number
of years judging by the amount of print devoted to the subject in american
library journals the force of this sense of constriction has been somewhat
mitigated in all but the copyright libraries by the general lack of funds
available for book purchasing and by the increasing price of books however
when space in the library does become filled obviously something must
be done to create more space because the flow of material is certainly not
going to cease

pegram lecturers are supposed to talk about science and
its place in society the ordinary way of doing this would
be either to talk popular science or to adopt one of the various
styles in humanistic discussion of the reactions between men
and science previous lecturers in this series have given
accounts of the content of space science and made excursions
into the philosophy and the history of science although
professionally my concern is with the history of science i have
a certain prehistoric past as a physicist and this has led
me to treat these lectures in what is perhaps an extraordinary
way
my goal is not discussion of the content of science or even
a humanistic analysis of its relations rather i want to clarify
these more usual approaches by treating separately all the
scientific analyses that may be made of science why should
we not turn the tools of science on science itself why not
measure and generalize make hypotheses and derive
conclusions

them as well as those who design the overall systems in which they are
used i would expect primarily to draw my readers from among the
designers of information systems and such prospective users as teachers
writers librarians lawyers design engineers and professional managers

all the research reported in this book arose out of an attempt some
years ago to study an industrial concern as a community of people at
work that is in much the same terms one would use in a study of
conduct and relationships in a village an urban neighborhood or a
small primitive community this aim was never realized because it
soon became evident that the social structure of the factory interlocked
with and often mirrored that of the small isolated town in which it
was situated the wider study which then appeared necessary was not
practicable and the enquiry petered out rather inconclusively assuming
its present significance only in the context of later studies

this paper presents a conceptualization of information as related to the
decision problems of the recipient the orientation is toward a formal
definition of behavioral elements in an individuals purposeful state
specifically these elements are his objectives his valuation of each
objective his possible courses of action the efficiency of each course of
action in achieving each objective and his probability of choice for each
course of action
the amount of information in a purposeful state is explicitly defined in
terms of the probabilities of choice of the available courses of action
the amount of information in a message is defined as the difference between the
amount of information in the purposeful state following the message and the
amount of information in the purposeful state preceding the message the amount
of instruction in a purposeful state is defined in terms of the efficiencies
of the available courses of action and the amount of motivation is defined in
terms of the values of the objectives the amounts of instruction and
motivation in a message are defined just as information is by comparing the
amounts in a purposeful state before and after receipt of the message
the value of a purposeful state to an individual is defined as a function of
the amount of information the amount of instruction and the amount of
motivation in the state this concept can be generalized to express the value
of the state to some other individual

five assumptions commonly made by designers of management information
systems are identified it is argued that these are not justified in many if
not most cases and hence lead to major deficiencies in the resulting systems
these assumptions are 1 the critical deficiency under which most managers
operate is the lack of relevant information 2 the manager needs the
information he wants 3 if a manager has the information he needs his decision
making will improve 4 better communication between managers improves
organizational performance and 5 a manager does not have to understand
how his information system works only how to use it to overcome these
assumptions and the deficiencies which result from them a management
information system should be imbedded in a management control system
a procedure for designing such a system is proposed and an example is given
of the type of control system which it produces

several authors have proposed using scoring models for prescriptive analysis
of the r and d project selection decision problem this research indicates
that these models do not meet with important practical requirements for
example many authors recommend a multiplicative index over an additive
index in order to generate a wide range of project scores the additive
index is shown to have important advantages over the multiplicative index
the most serious shortcoming in the models however is the relatively arbitrary
fashion in which the models have been constructed and the failure of the model
builders to recognize the impact of certain structural considerations on
resulting project scores comparative analyses relating project rankings
produced by scoring models to rankings produced by a profitability
index and by a linear programming model demonstrate that the performance of
the scoring model is highly sensitive to decisions made during the development
of the model considerations such as 1 the underlying distributions of
project data 2 time preferences 3 the number of ranking intervals or
categories and 4 the width of the intervals all have important implications
for final project scores and associated rankings

the managerial grid method of designating various
styles of leadership avoids these semantic traps even more
it shows how a leader can simultaneously maximize both
the methods which are productionoriented and those which
are peopleoriented thus instead of putting a manager in
a dilemma of choosing one or the other alternative it
illustrates that there are ways he can gain the benefits of
both it puts various methods of managing problems into
a framework where the leader can identify study and
change his own behavior thus he is in a position to understand
it better to evaluate the results it produces and to
encourage its use by others

the marc machinereadablecataloging pilot project was an
experiment to test the feasibility of distributing library of congress
cataloging in machinereadable form to a variety of users this project
grew out of the conviction of many librarians that automation was becoming
necessary if libraries were to keep up with the rising tide of new
materials and the mounting demand for rapid information although there
were other library procedures which stood to profit from mechanization
it was felt that devising a method of recording bibliographical information
in machinereadable form was basic to the solution of other problems

service of centrally produced machinereadable
cataloging data to a fullscale operational
system in the design stages in two short years
the library community both here and abroad has
accepted marc and recognizes its potential
for the future the single most significant
result of marc has been the impetus to set
standards there is no doubt that eventually
standards would have been designed for
machinereadable bibliographic records character
sets and codes for place and language marc
accelerated standardization and still more
important the standards are being set and agreed
to be a large segment of the library community
the cooperation among the producers and users

in this book we give a mathematical account of some of the methods of data
simplification which are involved in or suggested by the practice of biological
taxonomy the computable methods derived are offered as potentially useful
tools for taxonomists rather than as substitutes for their activities
superficially similar problems of data simplification arise in pattern
recognition and in the various sciences which make substantial use of
classificatory systems biological taxonomy ecology psychology linguistics
archaeology sociology etc but more detailed examination shows that the
kinds of classification used and the kinds of data on which they are based
differ widely from science to science whilst we recognize that some of the
methods described here particularly in part ii of the book are more
widely applicable we have deliberately limited discussion to biological
taxonomy the emphasis throughout is on the clarification of the mathematical
properties of methods of automatic classification and of the conditions under
which their application is valid so that anyone who wishes to apply the
methods in other fields shall be aware of their limitations and of the lines
along which they may profitably be developed and modified

the word communication will be used here in a very broad sense
to include all of the procedures by which one mind may affect
another this of course involves not only written and oral
speech but also music the pictorial arts the theatre the ballet
and in fact all human behavior in some connections it may be
desirable to use a still broader definition of communication
namely one which would include the procedures by means of
which one mechanism say automatic equipment to track an
airplane and to compute its probably future positions affects
another mechanism say a guided missile chasing this airplane
the language of this memorandum will often appear to refer to
the special but still very broad and important field of the
communication of speech but practically everything said applies
equally as well to music of any sort and to still or moving
pictures as in television

the work to which this chapter forms a preface arises out of a deep

past and present theories of the structure of language this
dissatisfaction may be understood more readily and the suggestions
which make up the body of this work may appear in clearer perspective

the scientific study of language has been developing with particular
rapidity during the past decade or so one thinks immediately of
the basic work of zipf and skinner of the developments in information
theory in concept formation in second language learning in
work association research and generally of the increasing integration
of the psychological and linguistic approaches as reflected in the
activities of the social science research council committee on
linguistics and psychology almost every new issue of a social
science journal brings additional evidence of this heightened activity
a significant aspect of much of this development has been the
devising and application of new quantitative measurement techniques
during the past six or seven years a group of us at the
university of illinois has been concentrating on the development
of an objective measure of meaning and this book is largely a
progress report of that research

the focus of the book can be summed up in its subtitle a strategy
for the study of attitudes this strategy is developed by devoting
considerable attention to the nature of the concept of satisfaction and
particularly to the requirements for scientifically adequate measures of
satisfaction in fact it is the emphasis on a comprehensive set of
requirements for sound measurement rather than on just one or two
elements of it which is the quality that sets this book apart from any
previous report in the area of job satisfaction
not the least of the values of this book is its basic utility for both
academicians and practitioners for the former it should serve as a
powerful spur and guide to further fundamental research on the nature
and correlates of satisfaction for too many years we in this area have
been plagued by inadequately conceived and poorly developed measuring
devices this has led to a plethora of studies each using a different
scale or measuring instrument as a consequence this has opened the
door for almost anyone to claim the solution for making sense of the
jigsaw pattern of findings relating to satisfaction at the very least the
present volume should provide researchers with a thoroughly developed
measuring instrument that will allow comparability of results across
studies if so this may well bring some meaningful order to the present
rather chaotically structured literature on job satisfaction

there is probably no measurement task which public
servants face which is more difficult than that of measuring
the quality of service it is as difficult to measure the
quality of hospital service or of schools or of social
welfare programs as it is to determine the quality of library
service it is equally as difficult to decide what actions to
take in order to improve service
legislators urban and regional planners consultants
boards of trustees accrediting teams librarians and a
host of other decision makers must act on the basis of some
conclusions about the quality of service offered by library
systems this handbook is intended for these groups and
especially for practicing librarians the pervasiveness of
the problem across all public service institutions however
leads us to hope that the handbook will be of interest to
other groups

of an innovation the innovation is a medical one a drug which
physicians use in everyday practice the setting is in the midwestern
united states in the 1950s this study gives a glimpse of one small
part of the great changes that have recently occurred within medicine
and thus is of specific interest to the medical profession and its
allied institutions
but more generally the question of the spread of an innovation
is of interest to all students of society particularly in an age of
change and in our complex and massive society an understanding
of the way in which an innovation can spread  for better or worse

operation this will add the final chapter to
the present medlars story at a time when
the library is on the threshold of developing
an entirely new system utilizing the latest

the reader interested in a complete chronicle
of the librarys experience with medlars is
advised to combine the reading of this report
with a rereading of the original medlars
story thus he will be able to develop a

this book originally set out to be a kind of reportingindepth of
the american library association preconference on acquisitions
held in atlantic city in the summer of 1969  a report embracing not
only the essential content of the formal speeches but also the floor
discussions and afterhours bull sessions
meanwhile however a closely similar treatment of the problem of
how to buy library materials long in process suddenly shaped up and
was published by ala in november 1969 this was purchasing library
materials in public and school libraries by evelyn hensel and peter d
veilette
a treatment of the acquisition process in college and university
libraries was also taking shape at this time and became the january
1970 issue of library trends the acquisition problems of research
libraries were likewise getting detailed examination in the two annual
international seminars on approval and gathering plans in large and
medium size academic libraries sponsored by western michigan university
in the fall of 1968 and the fall of 1969

an experiment is described which attempts to derive quantitative indicators
regarding the potential relevance predictability of the intermediate stimuli
used to represent documents in information retrieval systems in effect
since the decision to peruse an entire document is often predicated upon
the examination of one level of processing of the document eg the
citation andor abstract it became interesting to analyze the properties
of what constitutes relevance however prior to such an analysis an
even more elementary step had to be made namely to determine what portions
of a document should be examined
an evaluation of the ability of intermediate response products irps
functioning as cues to the information content of full documents to predict
the relevance determination that would be subsequently made on these documents
by motivated users of information retrieval systems was made under controlled
experimental conditions the hypothesis that there might be other intermediate
response products selected extracts from the document ie first paragraph
last paragraph and the combination of first and last paragraph that would be
representative of the full document as the traditional irps citation and
abstract was tested systematically the results showed that
1 there is no significant difference among the several irp treatment
groups on the number of cue evaluations of relevancy which match
the subsequent user relevancy decision on the document
2 first and last paragraph combinations have consistently predicted
relevancy to a higher degree that the other irps
3 abstracts were undistinguished as predictors and
4 the apparent high predictability rating for citations was not
substantive
some of these results are quite different than would be expected from previous
work with unmotivated subjects

the paper reports the results of a two week questionnaire survey of the use
of biomedical periodical literature carried out at the uk national lending
library in february 1969 the survey was designated to discover the subject
date and language characteristics of the borrowed literature the most
frequently requested journals and the most popular sources of references
to biomedical publications
the loans were spread over 1084 titles although 9 per cent of the issues
involved only 2 per cent of the titles the literature in most demand was
less than one year old and in the case of medicine 50 per cent of the requests
were for literature lss than 3 12 years old the halflife for the biological
literature was somewhat longer at 5 34 years the majority of issues 878
per cent involved english language periodicals
overall the principal sources of references to the requested literature
were citation lists in other periodical articles regarding the more recent
literature however abstracting and indexing journals were the primary
sources of information for medical references index medicus was the most
used indexing publication and for biological references current contents

why do libraries use microforms according to a 1974 survey by a
micropublisher saving space was the reason given by most respondents
holmes on the other hand found to acquire materials not otherwise
available as the major reason others include 1 instead of binding
serials journals are retained unbound for two to three years after
publication the period of heaviest use and are then discarded and
replaced by microform versions 2 to preserve deteriorating materials
3 easing access to bulky materials such as newspapers 4 to provide
working copies of materials too delicate for continued use such as rare
books 5 to save money  in most cases the cost of an outofprint set or
serial backfile will be substantially less in microform than the cost of a
fullsize reprint or the cost of the original on the used book market
6 ease of acquisition  ie acquiring materials which would otherwise
be difficult to acquire 7 mutilations reduced

the referee system in science involves the systematic use of judges to
assess the acceptability of manuscripts submitted for publication the
referee is thus an example of statusjudges who are charged with evaluating
the quality of roleperformance in a social system they are found in
every institutional sphere other kinds of statusjudges include teachers
assessing the quality of work by students and as a recent institutional
change students officially assessing the quality of performance by teachers
critics in the arts supervisors in industry and coaches and managers in
sports statusjudges are integral to any system of social control through
their evaluation of roleperformance and their allocation of rewards for
that performance they influence the motivation to maintain or to raise

this paper analyses the formation of a new discipline molecular biology
from the development of phage work it argues that such social variables
as the competitive position and relative status of each of the specialities or
disciplines from which a new one is formed are not sufficient to explain
phage works development into the specialty of molecular biology even
though persons in physics a field with high academic standing decided
to enter biology which had a lower academic standing and even though
some recruiting of students occurred these factors alone are not sufficient
to account for the development of the specialty particularly given the
competitiveness of modern conditions in the emergence of molecular
biology from phage work the variables of status and competitive position
adduced by professors bendavid and collins to explain the emergence
of experimental psychology from the hybridization of physiology and
philosophy seem to be less important than other normal activities which
occur in scientific development

the plan of this book follows our definition of organizations
as social units that pursue specific goals which they are structured to
serve obviously under some social circumstances therefore the book has
three foci organizational goals organizational structure and organizations
and their social environment considerably more space is devoted to
organizational structure than to the other topics for two reasons first
more research has been conducted and more writings are available on
organizational structure than on organizational goals chapter 2 and
environment second the major schools of organizational analysis have fixed
their interests on structural aspects of the organization and thus we may
best evaluate these different approaches in the context of organizational
structure

this outline is based mainly on lectures given at the northwestern
polytechnic to students studying for the library associations registration
examination in classification and cataloguing
it is hoped that it will help to meet the need increasingly felt in
recent years by students and teachers of the subject for a reasonably simple
textbook on library classification which takes account of the considerable
developments which have occurred in the subject in the past 25 years as is
well known a great deal of this has been due to dr ranganathan and also
in more recent years to mr b c vickery as a result of these developments
a coherent theory of library classification has been established in each
of its three major departments  in subject analysis in notation and in
the alphabetical indexing of systematic orders it is now possible to
construct library classifications whose efficiency in the two basic functions
of relating subjects helpfully and of locating them rapidly ad unerringly
is considerably greater than the schemes we have so far used moreover they
are easier to construct

be of interest to those of any discipline concerned
with new developments in science of the last
quarter century it is addressed principally to the
student of human behavior as that study is
approached from the social side this is so partly
because that is the editors main competence and
interest but primarily because the study of human
behavior is the general area of science that has
least responded to the exciting challenge of the
modern systems outlook yet it is precisely this
general area that stands to gain the most from
insights into the workings of the more complex

based on a fresh approach to this problem it is an important
study since the analyses and interpretations of the authors
suggest that a breakthrough may well have been made to provide
new insights into the nature and method of operation of job
attitudes
the senior authors were well prepared for their task having
recently completed a comprehensive review and analysis of the
research in this field reported in job attitudes review of
research and opinion this review of several thousand articles
and books regarding the factors relating to job attitudes and the
effect of job attitudes on work performance indicated much

a documentation office in which a large number of publications and
patents in chemistry would have to be processed this large collection
would be made available to a large group of elements without restrictions
to permit a large frequency of use and to maintain this also with increases
in file sizes it becomes necessary to limit especially that faction of the
task which consists in the retrieval activities paper
savings in the retrieval activity are possible only at the expense of
greater effort in indexing and by heavier use of technical aids we have taken
the second path by consciously applying the principles to a highly detailed

represented model of the communication process can be deduced that shows
the transfer of meaning between communicator and recipient through
communication channels and mediators the distinguished communication
structures are communication sequences chains nets and systems with an
universal definition of data as fixed representations of facts by means of
signs the various meanings of the term information are terminological to
differentiate as information information process and informations
the theory of signs makes the differentiation of syntactical semantical
sigmatical and pragmatical information possible adequate to communication

concurrently with the recon pilot project the recon working task force
undertook to consider certain basic questions of retrospect conversation
that are of national scope
first is it feasible to define a level or subset of the marc format that
would allow a library using the lower level to be part of a future national
network
second is it possible to use machinereadable records from a variety of
sources in a national bibliographic store as a way to reduce the conversion
effort on the national level
third what are the problems of producing a national union catalog from
machinereadable records
as these studies and the pilot project progressed it also became apparent
that there were many practical difficulties in carrying out a largescale
conversion project therefore it seemed essential to investigate alternative
strategies for recon that might yield broad benefits in a reasonable short
time span

this book has grown out of a study undertaken for the committee on scientific
and technical information cosati task group on national systemss for
scientific and technical information in support of their examination of national
document and information systems the emphasis of the study as stated by
cosati is as follows
1 initial and primary priority will be placed on national systems
relating to scientific and technical documents their handling and the
management of such documents specific matters to be reported on will include
the current organizational and functional situation in the united states the
extent to which known deficiencies are causing a reduction in the potential
for technical effectiveness in the united states scientific and technical
community the alternatives which are available and economically feasible for
correction of these deficiencies and one or more action plans which can be
followed by governmental especially including congress and nongovernmental
units
2 secondary attention will be given to development of programs which can
be undertaken with government support for identifying analyzing and giving
a structure to the total flow of scientific and technical information in the
united states

one of the most fundamental problems in the field of information retrieval
is that of determining the circumstances under which it might be necessary to
introduce an information retrieval system as an aid to a given population of
scientists it is proposed that this problem be examined in terms of the
transmission and development of ideas within a population specifically the
transmission of ideas within a population will be treated as if it were the
transmission of an infectious disease that is in terms of an epidemic process
an attempt will be made to indicate the role of information retrieval in the
development of such a process

one of the most intriguing problems of modern science is the obscure nature
of its own growth indeed there are few notable scientists who have not at
one time or another given serious thought to the questions of how their
particular science has reached its present state and what will be the course of
its future development these questions seem to be of such importance to
scientists that they have emerged as fundamental scientific problems in their
own right
goffman and newill have pointed out that the process by which ideas spread
within a population of scientists possesses epidemiological properties and can
therefore be investigated as an epidemic process consequently a new set of
mathematical tools can be applied to the problem of explaining the nature of
scientific development in particular this approach makes it possible to
establish the relative importance of past lines of inquiry within a given area
of scientific research and to predict the future behavior of existing lines
of investigation as well as the emergence of important new ones within the
given area
the purpose of this communication is to demonstrate this method by applying it
to the development of knowledge about mast cells in his recent comprehensive
survey of this subject prof hens selye has assembled a full bibliography
in which every aspect of the mast cell is dealt with this bibliography
constitutes ideal data for the application of epidemic theory to the spread of
scientific ideas since it provides us with all the contributions to the
subject area from ehrlichs discovery of the mast cell in 1877 until 1963

sirin his recent article bc brookes propounds an ingenious mathematical
framework to determine which periodical volumes a library should hold he is
careful to point out that the selection will need regular review and revision
in case the value of the aging factor a or the
contents of the bradford set change from year to year there is as yet very
little experimental evidence on the consistency
of either such limited evidence as there is suggests that the aging factor
is reasonably constant but the position of
the bradfod set is less satisfactory the nature conservancy librarians j m
weingott and s m penny unpublished have lent me a list of titles cited in
the journal of ecology three or more times in
195556 and a similar list for 196566 there are 150 periodical titles in
the two lists but only fortytwo 28 appear in
both of the thirtythree titles cited nine or more times in either year
only eight 25 attained that level in both and
twelve were cited less than three times in the other year the kendall rank
correlation coefficient between the two years is 018 and not significant
there is another major practical problem the article assumes that the data
analyzed to obtain aging or utility factors and bradford sets are valid
parameters of the relative value of the literature to the readers there is no
mention of the type of data to use the reader who sought guidance from the
earlier literature cited would find practical techniques described in which
analyses of citation frequencies are used to calculate utilities discussed in
terms of library use krauze and hillinger have
discussed the difference between citations in one article and future citations
to that article their work implies a more complex
relation between a and u than brookes suggests in any case the validity of
citations for forecasting library consultations
remains unproven and there are prima facie reasons why the relationship is not
necessarily close for example one item in a list of references is often
intended to lead to a chain of earlier papers again
each citation represents an authors selection from a wider group most of
which he has consulted in a library in neither case is there any
inherent reason for similarity of age distribution or of pool of titles between
the list of citations and the items read by the author or his readers

our experiment was based on volume 24 of nuclear science
abstracts nsa which contains about 53000 citations we
used the generalized filemanagement system master control
which can operate in either an inverted or a linear search mode
the inverted mode uses a table composed of the unique
vocabulary contained in one or more data elements along with
all record numbers in which each vocabulary word occurs for
example an inverted table constructed on titles will have one
entry for each unique word of every title in the data base plus
the record numbers in which each vocabulary word occurs for
example an inverted table constructed on titles will have one
entry for each unique word of every title in the data base plus
the record numbers in which each word was found in master
control a word is defined as any set of characters bounded on
either side by a legal separator such as a blank period comma
colon etc on the other hand in a linear search mode the
data element is compared with the profile word character by
character which results in a prohibitively timeconsuming
process for large data bases
we chose the invertedtable technique because of the large
amount of data to be searched individual tables were
constructed from the titles of the articles nsa index terms and
titles and index terms combined nsa index terms are controlled
by the euratom thesaurus as revised for nsa
we used two criteria in the study first the questions had
to be of real interest to laboratory personnel some of the
questions had actually been submitted by other members of the
staff to be run concurrently on the same data base on an sdi
basis the others were especially constructed by the authors
for this experiment second citations obtained were to be
considered good or relevant only if they actually pertained to
the subject in question otherwise they were to be considered
false drops regardless of the number of words matched
between the profile and the citation

the results are described of research and development activities of the
mechanized information retrieval laboratory of the niitekhim research
institute aimed towards creating a descriptor language for an information
retrieval system in the field of chemistry and chemical engineering the
objectives of an optimum reduction of retrieval noise and maximum recall have
required the introduction of grammatical and transformational devices into the
language the former condition is provided for by a matrix notation of
document search patterns and requests while the latter condition is met with
the help of the transformational devices of the language
examples of search requests and patterns are considered which illustrate
the resolution of the grammatical and transformational devices being
developed these are said largely to eliminate subjectiveness in assigning
relational factors in search patterns and requests
the relevancy criterion is formulated a retrieval algorithm based on this
criterion has been compiled
experimental searches were conducted on a minsk22 computer the results
were analyzed to evaluate the grammatical and transformational devices and to
verify indexing principles devised for the automated retrieval system under

the methods and results of an endeavor to develop an information retrieval
language for automatic retrieval systems meant for handling a polytechnical
document collection are described the descriptor dictionary includes general
and special terms both singleword and phrase terms which is conducive to
higher recall and relevance it comprises a classified index and a
lexicosemantic index as well as tables of generic relations the size of the
dictionary is 5542 descriptors and 3073 keywords
the indexing procedure includes analysis of document content and its
characterization by keywords elicited from natural text and creation of the
search pattern using the descriptor dictionary the techniques are described
which are applied to analyze the documents into semantic aspects that
constitute the elements of the formalized model of a documents condensed
content the procedure employed to translate a text into the retrieval
language comprises selection of words both from the title and the body of
the document
main principles for retrieval efficiency determination using
mathematicalstatistic methods are given
tests on multisubject collections show a probability of 85 recall and
70 relevance at a standard deviation of 25 these findings have been
corroborated by the results of the basic experiment on a file of up to
2500 search patterns using 42 requests among the factors of losses there
are the poor quality of abstracts into cards and the absence of a single
abstracting procedure it is proposed that abstractors should be in future
charged with writing abstracts in keywords and ultimately in the descriptor
language the experimental results attest to the feasibility and practical

the nature of an arbitrary classification is considered from the viewpoint
of its sign function the structure of the taxons described by a given
classification is treated as the referent the denotate the formation of
taxons is shown to be connected with the preliminary arrangement of the subject
area into a classification field
the classification concept is connected with the structure and nature of
the classification characteristics a typology of classifications is
introduced distinguishing them by intensionality or capacity for expression
of the concept independent of the subject area differences are pointed out

perfect order on the generants corresponds to hierarchical tree
classifications the case of incomparability of the generants corresponds to

of adapting the british citizens advice bureau cab plan to the
united states carried out with the financial support and cooperation

in a ongoing study designed in part to evaluate
and encourage continuing education programs in
community hospitals postgraduate medical institute
pmi has determined that there is need for
guidance in the area of medicallibrary development
reports from pmi physician consultants who visited
more than 40 community hospitals indicate that
medicallibrary facilities are generally poor and
infrequently used by physicians the basic
weaknesses of these libraries fall into four
categories inadequate collections inadequate
personnel inadequate space and the absence of
any practical indexing system to facilitate use of
collections that do exist
failure to deal with these problems does not
reflect lack of interest but rather lack of stimulation
to do so and absence of any concerted source of
guidance in response to requests for such guidance
pmi has undertaken a community hospital library
development project in cooperation with the
new england regional medical library service
nermls at the francis a countway library of
medicine this report is concerned with the first
phase of this project  namely the formulation of
a list consisting of a minimal number of textbooks and
journals that can function as the core for a medical
library
explanatory letters and questionnaires were sent
to 400 specialists representing 50 areas of medical
practice including the basic sciences the
specialists chosen from regions throughout the
country were requested to recommend two textbooks
and two journals in their area of special interest
that they considered to be the most basic and
fundamentally useful for practitioners it was
also requested that recommendations be made in order

field holds for those now in it and those who might be drawn to it the
personality of those in the occupation and in its various subfields and
work roles the characteristics and perspectives of the institutional
administrators supply and demand facets of the manpower problem
organizational relationships in libraries and information centers
library education as a professionalizing and socializing force and the
implications of network development for manpower planning central to the
study rationale was the notion that librarianship should be viewed not as
a static institution committed solely to traditional objectives but as one
with the capacity to be responsive to changing environmental requirements
it was hoped that from the intelligence gathered from these inquiries
certain of the significant dimensions of the fields manpower concerns

one article each patterns of this kind have been observed by several

particular reference to large library collections the area presented by n1
distinct shelf heights is minimized for any collection that can be
characterized by an itemheight distribution when itemheight is continuous
the necessary conditions for the extremum are recursive in the optimal shelf
heights and the solution reduces to a simple computational search for
certain distribution functions as demonstrated in the example an additional
recursive relation between the solutions for different n further simplified
the computation considerable geometrical representations of both the model and
the solution method are presented the maximum increase in storage capacity

the similar model for a given actual language is a completely organized sum
of rules whose purely mechanical application should ideally allow one to
1 go from the given text in the language being studied to the formal description
of the sense of that text ie to its semantic representation  semantic
notation
2 go from a given meaning ie from a given semantic representation to a
text in the language being studied which will convey the same meaning
if the proposed meaning may be expressed in more than one way then all the

the central theme of most earlier organizational studies which have tended
to focus on the question of what is the one best way to organize irrespective
of the external environmental conditions facing the business in this
important respect this study breaks new ground nevertheless it draws
heavily on earlier studies in the field of organization behavior at harvard
business school and elsewhere as well as the related literature of the
behavioral sciences the authors not only report the findings of a comparative
study of ten organizations with different levels of economic performance in
three distinct industrial environments but also use these findings to unravel
some of the apparent contradictions in current organization theory a
discussion of the implications of these findings for the design and
administration of large organizations in relation to their specific market and
technological environments is also included

this book is about the theory of formal organizations it is
easier and probably more useful to give examples of formal organizations
than to define the term the united states steel corporation is a formal
organization so is the red cross the corner grocery store the new york
state highway department the latter organization is of course part of
a larger one  the new york state government but for present purposes
we need not trouble ourselves about the precise boundaries to be drawn
around an organization or the exact distinction between an organization and
a nonorganization we are dealing with empirical phenomena and the world
has an uncomfortable way of not permitting itself to be fitted into clean
classifications
authors are often convinced that the particular subjects with which
they are dealing are more significant than the world has acknowledged
we cheerfully make this claim for organization theory however much
organizations occupy the thoughts of practicing executives and
administrators and however many books for these practitioners have
been written about them the theory of organizations occupies an insignificant
place in modern social science most current psychology and
sociology textbooks do not devote even a short chapter to the
subject of formal organizations the handbook of social psychology
lindzey 1954 contains chapters on small groups mass media industrial
social psychology with only passing references to organizations
leadership and voting behavior there is no comparable chapter on
formal organizations and only scattered reference to them throughout

this book might be considered a conceptual inventory this is a
departure from the recent fashion of conducting propositional
inventories which assumes that important relationships have already been
explored berelson and steiner 1964 i assume merely that the concepts
relevant to important relationships exist and once having identified some
i hope to generate potentially significant propositions we lack the
systematic evidence that eventually must come but there are illustrative
studies cited to indicate that the propositions which are neither time nor
spacebound
i assume that there are differences among organizations and hope
to account for some of them but i also assume that there is not a one
toone correspondence between significant organizational differences and
the typical categories of business government medicine and education
likewise i believe there is not a direct correlation between the academic
disciplines and useful categories of complex organizations

the object of this book is to establish a means for organizing
collections of nonprint material so that greatest efficiency can match
most effective service no lesser goal is worthy of consideration
in discussing the problems of organization the examples of material
have been used to explain differences in treatment that can be made
responsive to the needs of the community that the library serves
nonprint material is a vital part of a modern library of whatever
type school libraries have made the greatest use of the material so
far to the point of becoming mediacenters but the avalanche of
information is not only in print form and the need for information
may often be satisfied only by nonprint material

the major intellectual challenges confronting an architect of a total
computerized library system is organization of a efficient file of millions of
bibliographic references from which a single entry can be retrieved swiftly
and uniquely research on file organization has concentrated on retrieval of
multiple entries possessing some equal or similar characteristic however a
basic library bibliographic file should be organized to yield a record unequal
and dissimilar to all others such a file is analogous to the familiar main
entry catalog which every library maintains and would have associated with
it supplementary index files of subjects titles call numbers and perhaps
other attributes

with network development for a number of important reasons
first the network concept implies removal of all geographic
barriers to knowledge this is made possible by advances in
telecommunications technology second a network implies
equal access by any individual for any purpose to the sum total
of the nations knowledge resources this has been a longstanding
educational goal and third a network implies positive

it is pointed out that communication processes can be represented as
epidemic processes consequently epidemic theory can be applied to the
study of any process in which information is transmitted within a population
the members of such populations need not be human beings but could be
microorganisms or even machines the fundamental notion of stability of an
epidemic process is introduced and a stability theorem is derived a
mechanism called an information retrieval process which instigates an epidemic
process is defined certain general properties of the mechanism are established
and the means of controlling it are discussed pontryagins maximum principle
is applied to the problem of achieving optimal control of an epidemic process
and it is shown that stability of the process is equivalent to stability in the
sense of lyapunov this result makes it possible to determine the conditions
for stability without knowledge of the solution of the differential equations
which represent the process

our purpose in writing this book has been to give a systematic account of
major topics in pattern recognition a field concerned with machine recognition
of meaningful regularities in noisy or complex environments
the most prominent domainindependent theory is classification theory the
subject of part i of this book based on statistical decision theory it
provides formal mathematical procedures for classifying patterns once they
have been represented abstractly as vectors
attempts to find domainindependent procedures for constructing these
vector representations have not yielded generally useful results instead
every problem area has acquired a collection of procedures suited to its
special characteristics of the many areas of interest the pictorial domain
has received by far the most attention furthermore work in this area has
progressed from picture classification to picture analysis and description
part ii of this book is devoted to a systematic presentation of these topics
in visual scene analysis

in the late 1960s nearly all professions in the united states thought
they faced severe shortages of manpower in their fields both in professional
and supporting areas librarianship was not immune there was more work to be
done than existing staffs could do there were budgeted professional vacancies
that could not be filled and concurrently there were concerns being quietly
expressed that some of the shortages could be ameliorated by a changed
utilization of existing manpower
it was at this time and out of these concerns that julius r chitwood then
president of the illinois library association appointed an ad hoc committee
on manpower training and utilization to study patterns of staff assignments
and to recommend to library administrators more effective ways of utilizing
professional staff after examining the use of professional staff in a few
libraries however it became clear to this committee of volunteer researchers
that they could not do the job which needed doing it was also clear that a
need was there that a small segment of the library manpower problem could
be more fully explored that the results of a serious study in illinois might
have national implications and that the resources for such a study should be
sought

patterns and the relevance of other audiovisual learning media
this is a book about the planning process not the details
of all parts of a building it will not tell you which floor
covering is best which light fixtures to use or which kind of
library shelving to buy these matters are treated in detail
by metcalf it will however try to tell you how to go
about solving these and the many other problems planners face

the notion of a plan that guides behavior is again not entirely
accidentally quite similar to the notion of a program that guides an
electronic computer in order to discover how to get the image into
motion therefore we reviewed once more the cybernetic literature
on the analogies between brains and computers between minds and
programs
our fundamental concern however was to discover whether
the cybernetic ideas have any relevance for psychology the men
who have pioneered in this area have been remarkably innocent
about psychology  the creatures whose behavior they want to
simulate often seem more like a mathematicians dream than like
living animals but in spite of all the evidence we refused to
believe that ignorance of psychology is a cybernetic prerequisite or
even an advantage there must be some way to phrase the new ideas so
that they can contribute to and profit from the science of behavior
that psychologists have created it was the search for that favorable
intersection that directed the course of our yearlong debate

in 1951 the british bibliography introduced the relatively new technique
of chain indexing to british libraries twenty years later with chain
procedure established as one of the standard techniques bnb again pioneered
a new approach to subject indexing when it adopted precis from its first
issues of 1971
to explain why this change was felt to be necessary we have to consider
these indexing systems in the light of the new approaches to handling
bibliographic data which have developed over the past decade of so two
forces in particular have affected both descriptive cataloguing and subject
indexing during this period firstly the introduction of computers
secondly and concomitantly the development of bibliographic data exchange
networks of which marc is perhaps the primary example
in some respects precis represents a parallel development in the field of
subject indexing traditionally indexing systems have also tended to be
dominated by the concept of a most significant term which once identified
by the indexer would be offered as the users access point to the alphabetical
file this applied most obviously to subject heading systems a good deal
of cutters rules for a dictionary catalog is devoted to the problem of
identifying this most significant term in a compound heading and presenting
it as the users access point even when this entailed a distortion of
natural language and the production of inverted headings the unselected
component would then be lost as an entry word unless the indexer also
created a further heading or headings in which case none of these headings
would be coextensive with the subject of the document
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1216</DOCNO>
since the first edition of library of congress subject
headings appeared 60 years ago american and other libraries
have increasingly relied on this list as the chief authority 
if not the sole basis  for subject cataloging there can
be no quarrel about the practical necessity for such a
laborsaving worryreducing work norabstractlyabout its
value as a global standardizing agent a means for achieving
some uniformity in an area that would otherwise be chaotic
undoubtedly it is a real boon to scholars as well as to
ordinary readers to find familiar fairly constant headings
in subject catalogs as far removed geographically as
washington dc and lusaka zambia knowledge and scholarship
are after all universal and a subjectscheme should ideally
manage to encompass all the facets of what has been printed and
subsequently collected in libraries to the satisfaction of the
worldwide reading community should that is but in the realm
of headings that deal with people and culturesin short with
humanitythe lc list can only satisfy parochial jingoistic
europeans and north americans whitehued at least nominally
christian and preferably protestant in faith comfortably
situated in the middle and higherincome brackets largely
domiciled in suburbia fundamentally loyal to the established
order and heavily imbued with the transcendent incomparable glory of
western civilization further it reflects a host of untenableindeed
obsolete and arrogantassumptions with respect to young
people and women and exudes something less than sympathy or

students who seek careers as teachers and researchers as well as for
practitioners who desire an uptodate review of operations research the
book can be used in halfyear or fullyear introductory courses for juniors
seniors or graduates in business economics and engineering curricula
the central goal of the book is to answer the question what are the
fundamental ideas of operations research the text does not presuppose any
advanced training in business administration industrial engineering

text processing problems such as automatic translation and automatic
abstracting create a need for defining explicit concepts which should be
characterized as the properties and quantity of semantic information
contained in document texts
in fact we need a formal model which lets us describe the process of
semantic text analysis
semantic text analysis could be described from the point of view of someone
with a different conception of the world  eg the text of very meaningful
article does not contain in fact any information for people who are not
specialists in the given mathematic field
therefore the formal model must contain descriptions of the conception of the
world of the given observer
such a description we call a thesaurus
semantic text analysis we interpret as changing the thesaurus in response
to a given text

knowledge on the other hand seems to be the philosophers task

theory and information systems may prick up his ears in fact some of

at birmingham university library it is proposed to implement in october
l972 a complete microfilm catalogue system this system originated from two
sources over the past two years various means have been evaluated of
converting the librarys card catalogues which were closed at the end of 1971
to a more compact form an interim report mentioned microfilming as one of a
number of possibilities at the time the production of hard copy was
envisaged but since then a true microform system has seemed preferable in
which the catalogue would exist as cassettes of film to be viewed by all users
on reader machines this system has been specified and costed and details are
included in this paper the impetus in reaching this viewpoint was provided by
the progress made over the last 18 months in the field of com which rapidly
commended itself as the choice of output medium for the new mechanized
marcbased catalogue which covers all the librarys serials and all
monographs acquired after january 1972 blcmp union catalogues in these

international conference of libraries and documentation centres was
held in brussels from 11 to 18 september 1955 during the conference
a whole forenoon was devoted to a group meeting on classification
general and special under my chairmanship the following two
resolutions recommended by the group meeting were adopted by the
plenary meeting on 16 september 1955
1 the fid recommends that a deeper and more extensive study
should be made of the general theory of classification including
facet analysis and also of their application in the documentation
of specific subjects
2 the commission proposes that in liaison with the fidca
committee a permanent working group be created in order to make
mutual exchange of theoreticians experiences and points of view
possible the rapporteurs shall bring about the creation of such a
group and furnish the information and means of work in order that
practical results may be obtained in the shortest time by making
mail exchanges easier and more frequent the scheme proposed by dr
ranganathan will serve as the basic document 154 further

little smaller than usual but never changing so much as to be unrecognizable
the persistence with which this number plagues me is far more than
a random accident there is to quote a famous senator a design behind it
some pattern governing its appearances either there really is something
unusual about the number or else i am suffering from delusions of persecution

the present paper is an attempt to formulate a positive
theory of motivation which will satisfy these theoretical
demands and at the same time conform to the known facts
clinical and observational as well as experimental it
derives most directly however from clinical experience
this theory is i think in the functionalist tradition of
james and dewey and is fused with the holism of wertheimer
goldstein and gestalt psychology and with the dynamicism of
freud and adler this fusion of synthesis may arbitrarily
be called a generaldynamic theory

multidimensional scaling is the problem of representing n objects
geometrically by n points so that the interpoint distances correspond in some
sense to experimental dissimilarities between objects in just what sense
distances and dissimilarities should correspond has been left rather vague in
most approaches thus leaving these approaches logically incomplete our
fundamental hypothesis is that dissimilarities and distances are monotonically
related we define a quantitative intuitively satisfying measure of goodness
of fit to this hypothesis our technique of multidimensional scaling is to
compute that configuration of points which optimizes the goodness of fit
a practical computer program for doing the calculations is described in a
companion paper

this book was written as an introduction to the administrative
relationships between small and mediumsized public libraries
and the cooperative library system in this book the definition
of a cooperative system is as follows a cooperative library system
is the combining of the talents and the resources of a group of
independent libraries within a reasonable geographic radius for
the purpose of attaining excellence in service and resources for
the benefit of the actual and potential users of all the member
libraries the plan for the book originated with questions directed
to a public library administrator and to a system director the
most pertinent of the repeated questions was how does system
membership change local library administration the sharpest
question was will the system ultimately take over local rights and
responsibilities

this book is an attempt to trace the origins of non
book activities in public libraries by which is meant the
arrangement of fiestas festivals and exhibitions the
conduct of classes contests lectures and excursions the
staging of plays the exhibition of movies the demonstration
of karate and judo and all similar activities not primarily
concerned with books now carried on by public libraries
since ideas about libraries as well as librarians have
passed back and forth across the atlantic with great facility
in this attempt to discover origins it seems wise to follow
however sketchily developments in both america and britain
and to note with some care what was happening in scholarly
libraries in popular libraries for the middle classes and
in libraries intended for the working classes

of experts on planning library services it has become increasingly
evident that effective public library services cannot be developed

potential contribution at a time when methods of communication
are undergoing rapid change as the traditional custodian of the
printed word the librarian has long had a distinctive and widely
accepted role the public library inquiry especially in the concluding
chapter of the present volume brings to the center of attention problems

arouse the interest of the public served by the libraries as well as aid
the librarians themselves to an appreciation of an important american

this institute was designed both to encourage the use of
quantitative measurement and to teach the techniques necessary
for such use it was hoped that an emphasis on statistical
measurement would upgrade administrative and research skills
and thus contribute to more efficient and effective library
management
studies of librarians academic backgrounds have indicated
a preponderance of humanities and social science majors in
the field too often librarians have had only a few courses in
mathematics and some actually have a psychological antipathy
toward numbers this antimathematics syndrome has
kept librarians from taking proper advantage of quantitative
methods

the purpose of this volume is to give an insight into the nature and scope
of the documents of international organizations and to provide information
about the work of documentalists and librarians in making the mass of
information available in these documents available to readers all too many
librarians regard government documents and in particular the documents of
international agencies as esoteric unlike the usual library materials in
format and publication pattern and as presenting problems of acquisitions
control and service so complex and so frustrating that they are best left to
the specialist in documents the result is that international documents are
a puzzlement to the general librarian and a source of frustration to the
ill informed administrator a situation exacerbated by the present general
tendency of library school curricula to ignore the question of international
documents except for cursory mention in one or at most two sessions of
a general course in government documents to which relatively few students
are exposed the information in this volume will allay the fears of the
generalist librarian it also provides the data on which to base additional
emphasis on international documents in the library school curriculum

librarian and as a textbook for the library school student it will try
to draw attention to significant social behavioral theoretical
organizational functional and operational generalizations about library

the selections are intended mainly for students in library schools and for
librarians in the field who have not yet made themselves conversant with the
literature of computerbased operations this is not a book to state the
proposition in the negative for those who wish to read on the theoretical
aspects of computers
the selections are brought together in seven sections the first the
challenge includes material on what is expected of librarians in the age
of the computer
the second section varieties of response does not by any means exhaust
developments in american libraries it does i believe contain representative
descriptions of some of the best work being accomplished
the third section theory of management contains an outstanding article by
richard degennaro of harvard the particular contributions made in this
article are described in the editorial comment immediately preceding this
third section
news services the fourth section required a considerable degree of
selection among a wealth of material and is indicative of the wide variety
of services which libraries are beginning to offer in the age of the computer
the considerable range of such services is exhaustively indicated in the
first selection of this section while those that follow describe specific
services now being offered or services in the planning stage
the material in the fifth section catalogs and the computer is on a
subject that has elicited considerable discussion the two articles selected
are on two aspects of the subject namely filing problems and comparative
costs
the sixth section copyright contains an article from the legal point of
view the more traditional library view of copyright has been ably
represented by verner clapp in an article cited in the section on additional
readings
the seventh section information retrieval testing is a subject which has
excited the attention of but few librarians yet its influence on subject

each kind of librarianship partakes of the general elements of librarianship
and each has a flavor all its own this book is intended to present the flavor
and philosophy of medical librarianship to the student or novice if it gives
a new perspective to some practicing librarians or administrators in health
science organizations so much the better
if it were ever possible to think of medical libraries in isolation it is
so no longer one must conceive of them as part of a medical system and
indeed as part of a system that goes beyond the narrow confines of medicine
as practiced by a single physician for a single patient it extends into
the health sciences as represented by dentists pharmacists nurses
veterinarians medical technologists medical associates and dozens of
others some not yet possessing a clear identity it includes research
education and practice in addition to the clinical sciences the system
involves the preclinical ones and preventive medicine and public health
increasingly socioeconomic considerations have moved into the mainstream
of medicine

the fundamental purpose of this volume is to assist its reader to
genuinely perceive the nature of scholarship and its relationship to
the goals of librarianship viewed in this way and perhaps as
antidote to the more rigidly formalistic treatments of the technical
matters of research the editors concern here has been less with the
rituals and far more with the fundamental nature of intellectual
inquiry and its societal contribution with the modes of analysis the
habits of thought and expression which characterize scholarship and
the scholar
another primary purpose has been to put research into a context which
clearly depicts the task of the researcher and so illuminates realistically
not only the rigor and the discipline but the human triumphs and joys
which derive from its accomplishment seen thus as a dynamic field fit
for the adventurer of the mind perhaps it may succeed in enticing more
to its fold from among those in librarianship with imaginative and creative
capacity who have not before held this perspective of research

this collection attempts to bring together a readable and germane group of
materials ranging from history review papers and practical exposition to
reports on current research and development and conjecture about the future
it is expected that these selections will be of interest and use to the
teacher and student it is also hoped that they will be of equal interest to
the professional librarian and researcher there has been a deliberate attempt
to exclude materials that have appeared in recently published collections
it is for this reason that the names of panizzi cutter martel hanson
dewey rider bliss haykin shera lubetzky and others do not appear a

this report describes the results of a study of a practical method of
preparing library of congress card catalog data in machine form for 1
the automatic typesetting of cards and book catalogs and 2 distribution to
other libraries throughout the country for all foreseeable bibliographic and
typographic applications of such data including preparation of local
catalogs
the first step of the method proposed is to type the card data on a
perforated tape typewriter in a way which identifies all of the items on the
card after the data is edited and corrected it is processed by a computer
to form 1 catalog card typesetting tapes 2 the national union catalog
3 library of congress books subjects catalog magnetic tape catalog files
and a master magnetic or perforated paper tape record copy for distribution
the procedure also allows the recording of data which does not now appear on
library of congress cards should studies find that the value of the data
exceeds the cost of recording it
a demonstration was performed in which cards were typed to produce
perforated tape records these record tapes were automatically converted to a
variety of output forms ranging from phototypeset catalog cards and book
catalog entries to tape typewriter and line printer produced catalog cards

stock control has been defined by buckland as the managerial
problem of organising the physical availability of books in relation
to readers while it has long been recognised that only a proportion
of the stock of academic libraries is actively used academic library
buildings grow both more expensive and approach capacity fullness with
remarkable speed in certain cases some new buildings are full even
before they have left the designboard stage it is difficult to avoid
the conclusion reached by rb morris in 1963 that in terms of long
range perspective responsible judgement suggests that there is no
feasible choice before libraries other than a wide and continuous
programme of selective book retirement library stock control
has not received the attention it merits from librarians whose energy
time and resources have been more than fully committed by the problems
of acquisition and the provision of an everincreasing range of services
for readers early investigations of this issue have tended to be
theoretical and carol seymour in her review weeding the collection
put forward the view that a librarian should be able to begin his plan
for weeding even if the day seems far off when weeding will be necessary
he also knows the sorts of information tools he will need to have at
hand when the day does dawn on his overgrown garden the pebul report
summarised the position in a remarkably appropriate metaphor when it
observed that weeding the bookstock in academic libraries was the
ungrasped nettle

in the final report of the first stage of an investigation into the comparative
efficiency of indexing systems the major portion of the two years spent on
this present stage has been involved with the analysis of the considerable
amount of data which was obtained from the main test programme a difficulty
in this work was in deciding on the type of analysis which would be most likely
to yield valuable information in order to keep this volume within reasonable
limits it has been necessary to select from the analysis that was done and
even so in many cases only brief examples are given the major emphasis has been
placed on the reasons for failure to retrieve source documents for this is
considered to give some of the most interesting results of the project and has
not to our knowledge been previously attempted of possible equal importance
but certainly more difficult to evaluate is the reason for the retrieval of
nonrelevant references this analysis has not been attempted within the
present work but will be one of the matters to be investigated in the
continuation of the project

and dissemination of literature in the field of physics the growth of
the literature is considered quantitatively with respect to the form subject
and origin of published material this is related to the general growth in
scientific activity as exemplified by increases in numbers of physicists and of
expenditure on research the results of surveys aimed at ascertaining the
needs or demands of users of the physics literature are considered
particularly where these reveal weakness in the present organization of
information transfer and the reactions of users to new services intended to
remedy the deficiencies finally a number of recently established services 
some designed to meet hitherto unsatisfied needs  are described the role of

foremost among the nationwide goals of the library
community is the access to needed information resources for all
persons in all locations in the us the perceived right of
individuals to such access provides the foundation for national
information planning
for each library even the largest the hope of adequately
supplying its identified user groups has been greatly constrained
by simultaneous inflation of both cost and quantity of materials
while future technological developments may well make possible
online full text retrieval of all library materials at local
terminals or the instantaneous remote publication of materials

if the major premise is accepted that fully
effective machinestrategization of a retrieval system
depends upon the use of a hierarchically structural
but highly flexible notation as the equivalent for
the verbal access provided by either unitermic or
articulated conceptual indicators a faceted classification
logically emerges as the desideratum
the two aspects of a structural notation most
determinative here are hierarchicality and uniform
use of general categories the latter not merely
for the sake of uniformity as such but as the means
to a heightened flexibility these desiderata could
of course be present on the idea plane alone but
without their being present notationally they do not
furnish to a mechanized retrieval system the type
of assistance it requires for optimal functioning
the second minor premise ought to be that the
universal decimal classification being both
hierarchical and generalcategoric provides the desired
structurality but the melancholy fact is that this
desideratum is not always satisfied for instance
when udc uses direct division of a hierarchy when
division by general category would be equally appropriate

the collection includes 1 simple parent rings and 2 parent systems of
more than one ring in which the rings are united by having one or more atoms
in common it thus comparizes simple and fused ortho and orthoperifused
or annelated systems including spiro forms but not systems like biphenyl
or triphenylmethane in which the rings are united only by valences or by atoms
not belonging to the rings some systems are included in which a polar valence
is involved eg the fourmembered ring of betaine since these are often shown
in formulas as if true rings but in such cases the presence of the polar bond
is noted polar bonds in metallic salts eg calcium succinate are
disregarded as ring formers so also are coordinate linkages as in the chelate
compounds the word system is used to mean a single ring or a combination of
rings united one to another by atoms common to both
except for some special reason only systems representing known compounds
of generally accepted structure or definitely believed by authors to have a
certain structure are included the fact that a compound must have one or two
alternative structures is not sufficient for the entry of a system based on
either of them where there is doubt about an entry a query  is inserted

my main reason for writing this book is to reassert the methodological
priority of the search for the laws of history in the science of
man there is an urgency associated with this rededication which
grows in direct proportion to the increase in the funding and planning
of anthropological research and especially to the role anthropologists
have been asked to assume in the planning and carrying out of international
development programs a general theory of history is required if the
expansion of disposable research funds is to result in something other than
the rapid growth in the amount of trivia being published in the learned
journals the publishing of more and more about less and less is an
acceptable consequence of affluence only if specialization does not lead
to an actual neglect or even obfuscation of fundamental issues

no code of cataloging could be adopted in all points by every one

divide dictionary catalogs into shorttitle medium title and fulltitle

public 1861 and 1866 the boston athenaeum 187482 3 the

repetition of such phrases as the full catalog of a large library and
a concise findinglist i shall use the three words short medium and
full as proper names with the preliminary caution that the short family
are not all the same size that there is more than one medium and that
full may be fuller and fullest short if singlecolumned is generally
a titlealiner if printed in double columns it allows the title
occasionally to exceed one line but not if possible two medium does
not limit itself in this way but it seldom exceeds four lines and
gets many titles into a single line full usually fills three or four

necessary to exhibit the completeness of his dedication by
writing the history of the whole of science through all its

evaporated and feeling incompetent in too many scientific

my plan in this paper is to try to apply to the field of experimental
psychology the analysis of the characteristics of science and more
particularly the structure of scientific revolutions as conceptualized by
ts kuhn kuhn has not been accepted without criticism but that need not
prevent us from using his book as a point of departure for discussion i assume
that the reader will be familiar with kuhns analysisso that only a sketchy
summary of his position is necessary i will then take a brief look at some of
the history of psychology with special emphasis upon the major tenets of
behaviorism finally i will advance some evidence to suggest that we may well
be living in an era of revolution within psychology as well as without

as my title might suggest i wish to discuss some aspects of palermos recent
paper the thesis which palermo advocated is that kuhns view of scientific
revolution is applicable to the recent history of experimental psychology and
that in particular experimental psychology has had two paradigms already
with the appropriate scientific revolution between them and that the current
behavioristic paradigm may well be in a state of kuhnian crisis the
present note is divided into three parts the first questions palermos
assertion that the transition from introspectionism to behaviorism was a
standard kuhnian paradigmchange the second closely tied to the first
challenges the assumption that behaviorism itself can really be seen as a
kuhnian paradigm finally the third supports palermos thesis that behaviorism
is in a crisisstate but advances an alternative account of the reasons for
this

efforts have been made in recent years to use statistical studies of
scientific research papers as a means for deriving general statements about
trends in science for example there has been a continuing interest in the
question of how the frequency of citation of a scientific paper depends on its
age these investigations have however been mainly concerned with the major
branches of science only and have also perhaps been rather more interested
in identifying past trends than in making specific predictions for the future
although such results are obviously valuable it is also important to push
these analyses further into smaller areas within a main scientific subject
division since such areas may have significantly different bibliographical
properties from the subject average one particularly important aspect of
such work concerns the origin of new growth areas within a major discipline
we can specifically pose the question is it possible purely from a
statistical analysis of scientific research papers to identify the
appearance of a new growth area and if so how soon after its first
appearance can such an area be identified

part i of this paper described the first steps in mapping the scientific
literature using a new technique  cocitation  to measure the degree of
similarity among documents the work developed directly from an earlier
paper which defined this measure and explored its relationship to other
citation measures for identifying relationships among documents we now
report the outcome of an attempt to create maps of the scientific literature
the scales of these maps have been systematically manipulated so that they
present not only an overview of all highlycited papers in natural science but
also a detailed view of a single scientific specialty at each level we have
systematically sought indications of the validity of the mapping operation
and have indications that the maps display at least certain important aspects
of the specialty structure of science

the small college has stood staunch in its desire to
supply the liberal education and perhaps it has done
well in maintaining this position on the other hand
many of the large universities have shifted the
emphasis from undergraduate work to graduate study
still others have tried to develop both side by side
few of the small colleges have kept astride with the
inevitable consequences of such a situation the
few who have are sending an increasing number of
their graduates to these universities to complete their
training as an example of this it is the boast of
pomona college that over seventy per cent of her
graduates have taken subsequent professional training
it has become the evident duty therefore of the
small college to prepare its men not only to enter
such graduate schools but also to meet successfully
the everincreasing intensity of competition found
there this in addition to supplying a broad
cultural education this duty has brought with it
a number of problems of first magnitude one of the
biggest of these is the problem of adequate library
facilities
it is the purpose of this paper to discuss this
problem with special reference to the student whose
college major is chemistry

american journals for 1929 were chosen and the
references tabulated in table i are listed these
source journals together with the total number of
pages of the actual articles studied the total number
of citations in each journal the number of references
to books and to personal communications and the net
total which represents the citations to serial
literature it is these last mentioned references
which will be considered in further detail the
totals are probably slightly high due to unintentional

in this paper i propose a bibliographic system for science literature that can
eliminate the uncritical citation of fraudulent incomplete or obsolete data by
making it possible for the conscientious scholar to be aware of criticisms of
earlier papers it is too much to expect a research worker to spend an
inordinate amount of time searching for the bibliographic descendants of
antecedent papers it would not be excessive to demand that the thorough
scholar check all papers that have cited or criticized such papers if they
could be located quickly the citation index makes this check practicable
even if there were no other use for a citation index than that of minimizing
the citation of poor data the index would be well worth the effort
required to compile it
this paper considers the possible utility of a citation index that offers a
new approach to subject control of the literature of science by virtue of
its different construction it tends to bring together material that would
never be collated by the usual subject indexing it is best described as an
associationofideas index and it gives the reader as much leeway
as he requires suggestiveness through associationofideas is offered by
conventional subject indexes but only within the limits of a particular subject

since 1868 the number of mathematical publications per year
measured by counts of titles abstracted has grown from about 800
to 13000 at an average continuous compound rate of about 25 percent
per year doubling about four times a century deviations from the
exponential curve are clearly related to war depression and recovery if the
total number of publications prior to 1868 is estimated by extrapolating from
the curve of annual output the cumulative grand total of mathematical titles
grows from 41000 in 1867 to 419000 by the end of 1965 deviations from
an exponential growth of 25 percent per year are negligible except for two
pauses during world wars after which the observations continue parallel
to the theoretical curve the wellknown hypothesis of exponential
growth of the scientific literature is strongly confirmed but at a rate less
than half that found by price and other investigators the discrepancy appears
to be due to the failure of previous studies to take into account the
titles published before the beginnings of the time series used

a new scientific theory has been born during the last few years the theory
of information it immediately attracted a great deal of interest and has
expanded very rapidly this new theory was initially the result of a very
practical and utilitarian discussion of certain basic problems how is it
possible to define the quantity of information contained in a message or
telegram to be transmitted how does one measure the amount of information
communicated by a system of telegraphic signals how does one compare these
two qualities and discuss the efficiency for coding devices all of these
problems and many similar ones are of concern to the telecommunication
engineer and can now be discussed quantitatively
from these discussions there emerged a new theory of both mathematical
and practical character this theory is based on probability considerations
once stated in a precise way it can be used for many fundamental scientific
discussions it enables one to solve the problem of maxwells demon and to
show a very direct connection between information and entropy the
thermodynamic entropy measures the lack of information about a certain
physical system whenever an experiment is performed in the laboratory
it is paid for by an increase of entropy and a generalized carnot principle
states that the price paid in increase of entropy must always be larger than
the amount of information gained information corresponds to negative
entropy a quantity for which the author coined the word negentropy the
generalized carnot principle may also be called the negentropy principle of
information this principle imposes a new limitation on physical experiments
and is independent of the wellknown uncertainty relations of quantum mechanics

we were introduced by kuhn to the notion of scientific progress as a series
of qualitative changes each involving the overthrow of a prevailing paradigm
of thought by a new paradigm which alters the whole perspective of a science
palermo has appropriately summarized kuhns analysis it seems if we judge
by constant citations of kuhn and the references to paradigms crises and
revolutions among scientists and philosophers that he has induced a novel
selfconsciousness about the growth of scientific knowledge and the nature of
cumulativeness in the expansion of understanding  and not least among
psychologists this may be in small part though i doubt it because one of
psychologys concerns is the empirical study of the growth of knowledge jean
piaget whose influence in some quarters has now become so great that he
is hailed as a revolutionary in those quarters has for several decades been
developing a theory of the growth of knowledge  or if you insist of the
development of cognition  which like kuhns account in his preface kuhn
acknowledges illumination from piaget eschews accumulation and posits a
sequence of qualitative changes each of which completely reorganizes thinking

papers of his latest book argue and elaborate on this theme he says
all work in science is work directed towards the growth of objective

knowledge as masons work on a cathedral
i will first make some preliminary points about the word objective
this will give substance to issues which are in danger of becoming too
rarefied second i will outline poppers account of objectivity third
i will argue that despite the value of what he says his approach is
seriously misleading i will propose a formula for systematically transforming

effects of organizations upon the work of their members this book is
one of the first major studies to examine the relationship between a
scientists performance and the organization of his laboratory unlike many
previous expositions about the best environment for technical people the
findings resulted from extensive analysis of factual data from a wide
range of research personnel
work progressed over the next four years and a number of intriguing
results began to emerge but as these were discussed with other
investigators studying different kinds of r  d laboratories discrepancies
appeared it became clear that a broader study was needed before one
could be sure what constitutes a stimulating environment for research
personnel we set out to design a study in which standardized instruments
would be administered to scientists and engineers in several types of

the underlying concepts of simulation and experimential teaching methods
presented in this book have been borrowed from other fields  business
governmental and education administration primarily the values for library
educators are not hypothetical however for the methodology has been
successfully used over a period of time by a number of teachers and in a
variety of educational settings related to career training for librarians
neither is the approach overpersonalized much of the telling is in personal
terms in order to limit generalization to induce acceptance of responsibility
and to provide concrete examples in terms of teaching library administration
the assumption is that it will be easier for library educators to react
creatively to methodological discourse couched in library science terms than
if the same methodology were described in terms of high finance international
politics militarism or secondary school planning

the last ten years have witnessed rapid and often radical changes in
computer programming systems for social science data at least a dozen
different program packages collections or systems not to mention
hundreds of individual programs have emerged by now and are in use by
social scientists at universities and research centers all across the
country it is probably safe to say that the bulk of these systems
and programs represent the individual efforts of a small group working
at one institution often operating under a relatively restricted set
of research and computing assumptions this parochial tendency has left
students and researchers with the often bewildering and always time
consuming problem of learning new procedures for processing their data

the events of the past few years have led to a critical examination
of the function of science in society it used to be believed that
the results of scientific investigation would lead to continuous
progressive improvements in conditions of life but first the war and
then the economic crisis have shown that science can be used as
easily for destructive and wasteful purpose and voices have been
raised demanding the cessation of scientific research as the only
means of preserving a tolerable civilization scientists themselves
faced with these criticisms have been forced to consider effectively
for the first time how the work they are doing is connected with
the social and economic developments which are occurring around
them this book is an attempt to analyze this connection to
investigate how far scientists individually and collectively are
responsible for this state of affairs and to suggest what possible
steps could be taken which would lead to a fruitful and not to a
destructive utilization of science

mature and 3 that opportunities for entrance into the business
elite become more restricted with mature industrialization in

in our attempts to extend the description and explanation of
organizational processes we have shifted from an earlier emphasis on
traditional concepts of individual psychology and interpersonal
relations to system constructs the interdependent behavior of many
people in their supportive and complementary actions takes on a form
or structure which needs to be conceptualized at a more appropriate
collective level classical organization theory we found unsatisfactory
because of its implicit assumptions about the closed character of social
structures the development of opensystem theory on the other hand
furnished a much more dynamic and adequate framework hence our
effort in the pages that follow is directed at the utilization of
an opensystem point of view for the study of largescale organizations

during the past three hundred years the journal article has become
the main institutionalized form of formal scholarly communication
potential contributions to a discipline acquire credibility because
they have been published in a reputable journal zuckerman and merton
1971 who published what and where therefore becomes a central
question in the understanding of scholarly and in particular
scientific disciplines there have recently been a number of
investigations concerning the career of such publications this
career i suggest can be conceptualized into three stages
1 prepublication here the scholar writes the article circulates
it to colleagues and perhaps presents it at formal and informal
meetings garvey lin and nelson 1971
2 publication here the article is submitted to one or more journals
for publication consideration zuckerman and merton 1971
3 postpublication here colleagues either ignore the published
article or reward it through citations to it in their own work the
practice of citing a colleagues work is perhaps the main way in which
scholars indicate what they consider to be a contribution to their discipline

paper in the following i shall limit myself to four broad
areas of inquiry which have been so arranged that my own further
reflections figure rather prominently though by no means exclusively
in the first two sections while the latter two are more heavily
weighted with reports and comments on the research and contributions
of others

in recent years social scientists have given increased attention to
problems of inequality justice and discrimination in american society
the influence of ascribed statuses on the life chances of individuals
is being studied in an effort to estimate the fairness of social
institutions in rewarding talent social scientists are trying to
determine the extent to which socalled irrelevant characteristics
influence the ways in which people are judged by social institutions
and eventually reach social positions in the hierarchies of income
prestige and influence of the major institutions in american society
science has received perhaps the least systematic attention little
is known about how scientists achieve positions of renown this book
examines several aspects of a single basic question is the stratification
of individuals in science based upon the quality of scientific performance
or does discrimination obtain in the processes of status attainment
a more technical way of putting the same question would be to ask whether
universalistic and rational criteria predominate as the basis for
recognition in the social system of science

we tried to concentrate on a few variables that might define the
nature of a citation and to keep the rest of the variables constant in
particular we used references in articles in a single journal in a single
specialty of a single branch of science and in a narrow time period
specifically we investigated 30 articles dealing with theoretical high
energy physics and published in physical review in the years 1968 to
1972 inclusive

this book is an exercise in sociological theory
building it attempts to develop a theory of the social organization
of science i have tried to indicate its possible broader relevance
by pointing out certain basic parallels between the social system
of science and other social systems within society i hope further
that the approach used  even if not the specific conclusions i
have drawn from it  may be useful in bridging the gap that seems
now to exist between those sociologists who are concerned with
society as an entity and who analyze social behavior in terms of
its consequences for society as a whole and those sociologists who
are concerned first of all with the motives attitudes and goals
of the individual participants in these patterns of social behavior
my approach hopes to answer the question of why it is that most
individuals most of the time come to want to do what it is
that society needs them to do only when we can answer this
question satisfactorily can we develop a sociology capable of
providing both prediction and meaning

of the four chapters added to this edition two come from published
symposiaone of which is out of print and the other of which i am told
is nearing that same state of exhaustion
this chapter sets forth the concept of the influential identifies two
distinctive types of influentials the local and the cosmopolitan and
relates these types to the structure of influence in the local community
the second of these chapters contributions to the theory of reference
group behavior draws upon the ample evidence provided by the american
soldier to formulate certain conditions under which people orient themselves
to the norms of various groups in particular the groups with which they are
not affiliated
the other two chapters added to this edition have not been published
before the first of these continuities in the theory of social structure
and anomie tries to consolidate recent empirical and theoretical analyses
of the sources and consequences of that breakdown of social norms which is
described as anomie the second continuities in the theory of reference
groups and social structure tries to bring out some of the specially
sociological as distinct from the sociopsychological implications of
current inquiries into referencegroup behavior the intent is to examine
some of the theoretical problems of social structure which must be solved
before certain further advances can be made in the sociological analysis of
reference groups

by virtue of its peculiar links with the reward system in science
the communication system plays a central part in the maintenance
and growth of science it is the means by which the individual
scientist relates to the social system he publishes his work to
gain recognition and reads the publications of others to maintain his
knowledge the formal communication system also forms the basis for
the allocation of rewards instrumental and consumatory thus it is
a means of exercising social control
the informal communication system although important is the distaff
side its recognition is personal with more immediate and consumatory
rewards legitimation of objective or methods of work is rarely given by
the social system through informal systems of communication though it is
growing in importance as an information dissemination system

a general account is presented of the emergence growth and decline of
scientific research networks and their associated problem areas research
networks are seen to pass through three phases the first exploratory phase
is distinguished by a lack of effective communication among participants and
by the pursuit of imprecisely defined problems the second phase is one of
rapid growth associated with increasing social and intellectual integration
made possible by improved communication an increasingly precise scientific
consensus gradually emerges from a process of negotiation in which those
participants who are members of the scientific elite exert most influence
but as consensus is achieved the problem area becomes less scientifically
fruitful and as the network grows career opportunities diminish
consequently the third final phase is one of decline and disbandment of the
network together with the movement of participants to new areas of
scientific opportunity

the replication of scientific experiments is discussed stressing the problem
of communication between the originator of an experiment and a scientist
intending to replicate it models of communication are set up with reference
to established fields a more marginal field is then investigated in the light
of these models and it is concluded that scientists in the latter field should
not be seen as engaged in replicating original experiment but in negotiating
the rules of replication and hence the nature of the phenomenon under
investigation

variations in scientific productivity methods values and organizational

a widespread conception of the development of science holds that the great
discoveries are a result of the cumulative work of a vast number of
scientists those historians and philosophers of science who express this
point of view see the scientist who produces pedestrian research as an integral
part of the developmental process the great men of science stand atop a
pyramid of less distinguished and to a large extent invisible scientists
an alternative hypothesis holds that relatively few scientists are responsible
for advance in science and that in the broader historical perspective most of
the eminent scientists even of the calibre of nobel laureates and national
academy members of today are the pedestrians of history
this paper attempts to put these conflicting ideas to empirical test for the
field of physics three independent sets of data are analyzed one is drawn
from a stratified random sample of american academic physicists a second from
a subjective evaluation of significant contributions to recent physics a third
from a set of papers cited in the physical review all three sets of data
indicate that there is a sharp stratification in the use of work published by
various types of scientists the data support the hypothesis that the
physicists who produce important discoveries depend almost wholly on the
research produced by a relatively small number of scientists the implications
of these findings for the social structure of science are discussed and areas
for necessary future research are suggested

this paper reports correlates of departmental prestige american council on
education rating of the quality of graduate faculty 1966 for a sample of 125
departments in mathematics physics chemistry and biology the analysis
mostly uses multivariate linear regression large and significant correlations
with departmental prestige exist for measures of department size research
production research opportunities faculty background including quality of
phd university and faculty awards and offices combinations of from six to
nine indicators of these variables account for about threefourths of the
variance in departmental prestige when other types of variables are held
constant indicators of all except research opportunities remain significantly
associated with departmental prestige correlations of prestige with rates of
inbreeding and the proportion of foreign doctorates are discussed differences
in the correlates of prestige are small among the four fields studied it is
shown that prestige is correlated with average amount of informal scientific
communication and with departmental morale even after possible confounding
variables are held constant

this book is intended as an exploratory sketch of a revolutionary
scientific perspective and conceptual framework as it might be applied
to the sociocultural system this point of view and still developing
framework as interpreted here stems from the general systems research
movement and the now closely allied fields of cybernetics and information
or communication theory the principal goal of the book is to bring to the
attention of a larger number of social scientists particularly sociologists
the wealth of principles ideas and insights that have already brought a
higher degree of scientific order and understanding to many areas of
biology psychology and some physical sciences to say nothing of the
applied areas of technology to which they are essential

documentation in the social sciences is varied in form and content
written for people in many walks of life and fills several miles of shelving
in libraries that try to keep up with it graduate students who qualify for
positions as professional librarians have to learn about this vast
preserve and it is their need of guidance that explains the origin of this
book
the task of this book is to place in the readers hands a sort of chart
and compass to use in finding his way around and learning how the system
works
for each subject the treatment falls into two parts first a specialist
sought out for his grasp of the literature presents a bibliographical
review of basic monographic works for a collection of substantive material
this review is followed by a list of reference works informative
annotations are provided for all works except those adequately explained
by the title specialized works are included especially when they exemplify
types of sources important for reference purposes first priority goes to
works which may be looked upon as basic for a program of service to a
general clientele made up of scholars students and the public at large
if some stress falls on bibliographies it is because they serve as controls
for opening doorways to even vaster information and to sources that are
more obscure

bilbiographic publications
the chronicles of the allunion book reserve viniti abstract journals
publications of subject information centers and main libraries bulletins of
new publications as well as the main current foreign bibliography on some
branches of knowledge were considered
after comparative analysis valuable data were obtained in the completeness
of registration of literature and the efficiency of its reflection in
different publications on the types of classificatory schemes and intermediate
instruments on the quality of abstracts
the merits and drawbacks of basic bibliographic publications were shown and
recommendations for improving present bibliographic systems were suggested

or representative principles and rules the content of this book can
be viewed as of two types firstly the first and last chapters deal with
special materials in general the former dealing with basic cataloguing
principles and problems and the latter with the ultimate application
of such principles as manifested by the concept of the multimedia
catalogue and as aided by the computer secondly in between come
chapters dealing with individual categories of materials in detail each
category receives two types of treatment first the problems of both
approaches and description are examined as they apply to the particular
medium second the solutions put forward by representative codes are

after considering several different methods it was concluded that primary
journals for coverage of a given field can be selected rationally on the basis
of their citation frequencies in an appropriate secondary journal results
obtained on the example used rehabilitation as cited in index medicus during
the years 19681971 were similar to those from five other fields in that the
number of journals required for each percent gain in literature coverage
increased exponentially as the percentage of literature itself increased as
a consequence library coverage of any particular field can be specified as a
function of its budgeting commitment so that the maximum percent
coverage will be obtained for each dollar spent

the concept and discuss it in the context of the librarians conventional
planning and administrative activities this is done through a narration
of the stepbystep procedures followed in the conceptualization and
design of an actual library and information program the steps involved
are the following definition of the purpose of the program and financial
and administrative constraints on its design and operation as envisaged by
management a user study to determine needs and preferences of the presumed
audience of the program analysis and definition of program performance
requirements selection of methods and mechanisms for implementing
performance requirements conceptualization and documentation of program
design evaluation of design modification and completion of design
two basic principles that are discussed and emphasized are the need to
define what the program should be doing and what it should not be doing
and the need and means for determining real as opposed to apparent costs

the national science library is not a
library in the conventional sense of the word
but rather an information transferral agency
its activities are designed to provide the
canadian scientific and industrial communities
with direct and immediate access to the
publications and information required in their
daytoday work through cooperative measures
with both national and international information
agencies the nsl serves as the focal
point of a national scientific and technical
information network the library employs
a variety of mechanized techniques to
facilitate the storage retrieval and
dissemination of information during the past three
years it has operated an sdi service using ct
and isi tapes in november 1968 this sdi
service which had been limited to meeting
the needs of approximately 170 scientists in

type such as the usual library accession
list a fourth type the indexing and
abstracting journal is defined but not related
to the other three types the three current
awareness publications are shown to have a
relationship in terms of the number of
requests they can produce from a given set of
references or notices the sdi system will
produce about one request from ten notices
the intermediate type about one request per
hundred notices ad the unselected type
one request per thousand notices despite
the differences in the number of notices to
generate one request the cost to produce one
request is about the same for the three types
of tools also the usage of these tools is
related to the amount of user time available
and a curve is presented based on various

the following pages form the concluding portion of four lectures
delivered by me in the university of cambridge as sandars reader
in bibliography 1921
as the two pairs of lectures appeal to widely different classes
of the community i have decided to print them separately though
the underlying theme is the same viz the need for uniformity in
book classification as a preliminary to cooperative action in
library administration and bibliography
book classification is shelf classification and shelf classification
carried to its furthest limits leads necessarily to uniformity
in the extension and definition of its classes add to this a
chronological order of books in their classes and your scheme of
classification acquires a new value for it presents for each period
a bibliographical counterpart of the corresponding growth of the
activities of the human mind
my first two lectures dealt with this thesis in its practical
application to library work and the compilation of subject
bibliographies here statistical bibliography is considered in
relation to the growth of modern civilization
strictly speaking the province of statistical bibliography ends
with the presentation of the figures compiled their final
interpretation should be left to those possessing the necessary
qualifications i am therefore conscious that in attempting to
furnish some explanation of the interrelations of the various factors
which are associated with the growth of modern civilization i have
outstripped the limits of bibliographical propriety on this count
i offer no defense

this monograph is one of the few works in which the possibility of studying
semantics using statistical methods is proven with actual research
the semantic field of words denoting color in english french russian and
ukranian was chosen as a representative semantic object
the applied aspects of this work are particularly important the application
of those methods tested by the authors for solving problems of automatic
information processing as well as in language translation and instruction

the purpose of this book is to present an introduction to a body of
mathematics concerned with the abstract notion of structure its
preparation has been motivated by the belief that knowledge of the
mathematics of abstract structures will be of value to investigators
interested in various kinds of empirical structures the mathematics
with which we are concerned is known as the theory of directed graphs
or more briefly as digraph theory it deals with abstract configurations
called digraphs which consist of points and directed lines when
these terms are given concrete referents digraphs serve as mathematical
models of empirical structures and properties of digraphs reflect
structural properties of the empirical world since the same mathematical
terms can be given a variety of empirical meanings digraph theory has
applicability to many different fields of investigation

time i was a graduate student in theoretical physics already
within sight of the end of my dissertation a fortunate involvement
with an experimental college course treating physical
science for the nonscientist provided my first exposure to
outofdate scientific theory and practice radically undermined
some of my basic conceptions about the nature of science and
the reasons for its special success
those conceptions were ones i had previously drawn partly
from scientific training itself and partly from a longstanding
avocational interest in the philosophy of science somehow
whatever their pedagogic utility and their abstract plausibility
those notions did not at all fit the enterprise that historical study
displayed yet they were and are fundamental to many discussions
of science and their failures of verisimilitude therefore
seemed thoroughly worth pursuing the result was a drastic
shift in my career plans a shift from physics to history of
science and then gradually from relatively straightforward
historical problems back to the more philosophical concerns that
had initially led me to history except for a few articles this
essay is the first of my published works in which these early
concerns are dominant in some part it is an attempt to explain
to myself and to friends how i happened to be drawn from
science to its history in the first place

the rapid development of information retrieval methods since
the last war  together with the development of systems using
mechanical or electromechanical means punched cards for such
purposes followed later by electronic retrieval computers  have
led to transformations in the structure of classification or coding
systems for books and documents generally speaking document
specialists have tended to elaborate a large number of different
codes usually totally unrelated to each other each conceived
to meet the special documentation requirements of a particular
organization this is farther than ever  at least to all
appearances  from the original intention of 1895 of the founders
of the institut international de bibliographie now known as the
federation internationale de documentation ie the standardization
of classification methods

subject analysis for information retrieval is an area
which always seems deceptively simple to those without
previous background in it however extensive their background
in specific subject disciplines may be the basic
requirement seems easy enough to structure the statement
of a subject in such a way that it can be placed into and
retrieved from an ordered file
while attempts have been made to use simple noncomplex
terms or even single words it always becomes
evident that single words are often insufficient to express a
subject and that some subjects are in themselves complex
to express such subjects requires either that their constituent
concepts  not words  be separated and then recombined
or that only one part of the subject be shown
the former solution requires that the indexer perform
the necessary analysis and synthesis and then separate the
constituents for the searcher to reassemble the latter
forces the seeker of information to sort through many items
to find those bearing on the complex topic he wants and
ma require the indexer to decide under which parts of the
concept an entry should be made

the first edition of this book published in 1969 was prompted
by changes in the library association syllabus which for the first time
enables lecturers to treat classification and subject cataloging as
different aspects of the same topic these changes coincided with the
publication of the results of the cranfield project which showed
clearly that all indexing languages are basically the same however
although it was possible to teach these new approaches there was no
one textbook which covered the subject approach in the way that i felt
was needed the first edition was intended to fill this gap and its
reception both in britain and abroad showed that it did indeed fulfill a
real need it met with a very positive welcome from lecturers and 
more importantly  from students particularly in the united states
where british textbooks on classification had previously been regarded
with something akin to suspicion as the dean of one american
library school is alleged to have remarked what theory of classification

in 1955 the publications committee of the library association
approached my chief mr aj wells with a request that he should
write a book on subject cataloguing at the time mr wells was
preoccupied with the inauguration of the british national bibliography
card service and he made the suggestion which was agreed by the
committee that i should undertake the task the result is scarcely an
adequate substitute for the book which mr wells would have written
nevertheless he has had a major part in shaping my views on subject
cataloguing and in this sense the present book stems back to him
though he might not subscribe to all the views now put forward

the alphabetical subject catalog either selfcontained or as the subject
element in the dictionary catalog is a later development that the systematic
or classed catalog realkatalog catalogue raisonne in this country it
has almost completely displaced the latter the principal classed catalogs
now remaining are those of the engineering societies library in new york
the john crerar library in chicago and the science and technology department
of the carnegie library of pittsburgh there are nevertheless many things
to commend the classed catalog rudolf kaiser sums up the argument between
the classed and the dictionary catalog by stating that a library needs both
and explaining that the subject index fills the need as far as an alphabetical
catalog is concerned however his conclusion misses the mark since for
one not completely the master of the system of classification there is no
approach to the classed catalog save through an index yet the index is not
in fact as complete and direct a guide to the subject content of the librarys
collections as an alphabetical catalog rationally and fully crossreferenced

the subject of switching and finite automata theory needs no introduction
it has become a part of every computer science and electrical
engineering curriculum and rightly so it provides techniques useful
in a wide variety of applications and helps develop a way of thinking that
leads to understanding of the structure behavior and limitations and
capabilities of logical machines in this book i have tried to cover the
whole subject starting with introductory material and leading to the
more advanced topics assuming a minimal technical background on the
part of the reader i did not attempt to provide detailed techniques
for the design of specific circuits but rather to formulate methods and to
develop algorithms that can be applied to a broad class of problems
for once such general principles are understood the relevance of specific
procedures and their applicability to given problems are a matter of
engineering decisions

this study deals with syntactic structure both in the broad sense
as opposed to semantics and the narrow sense as opposed to
phonemics and morphology it forms part of an attempt to construct
a formalized general theory of linguistic structure and to
explore the foundations of such a theory the search for rigorous
formulation in linguistics has a much more serious motivation than
mere concern for logical niceties or the desire to purify wellestablished
methods of linguistic analysis precisely constructed models
for linguistic structure can play an important role both negative
and positive in the process of discovery itself by pushing a precise
but inadequate formulation to an unacceptable conclusion we can
often expose the exact source of this inadequacy and consequently
gain a deeper understanding of the linguistic data more positively
a formalized theory may automatically provide solutions for many
problems other than those for which it was explicitly designed
obscure and intuitionbound notions can neither lead to absurd
conclusions nor provide new and correct ones and hence they fail to
be useful in two important respects

no prior point in the history of man has there been so much discussion
about the rights and wrongs of the policy makers whether they be the
politicians in albany or sacramento in washington paris or moscow
the managers of farflung industrial firms or the people who run
educational institutions in all cases the citizen feels a perfect
right to have his say about the way in which the managers manage
not only has the citizen become far more vocal but he has also
in many instances begun to suspect that the people who make
the major decisions that affect our lives dont know what they

few librarians and library educators who criticize research relating
to their fields realize in 1972 how far research has progressed during
the last decade and a half the criticism usually relates to the
recognition that librarianship is more of a service and less of a fact
finding field of endeavor and that librarians are primarily trained to assist in
the research activities of others rather than to conduct their own one
can add here that the average librarian who spends about forty hours a
week on his job not always has the stamina to spend his free time on
original research or the writing of proposals which either are not
adequately funded or are not published with the prominence hoped for if
the librarianresearcher commits his findings to writing he is occasionally
criticized for writing poorly or for having dwelled on topics of limited
interest to the reviewer or he finds that while many praise his work there
are no funds possibilities or opportunities to translate his conclusions
into action

1 determination of user demands to discover what items of
information or documents customers seek why they seek
them and how they obtain them
2 classification of user groups and their demands to test a
hypothesis that it is possible to classify customers into
meaningful user groups possessing recognizable common
features and characteristic behavior patterns and to
classify group needs

to measure the demand on librarians and libraries in

this is an empirical study of information transfer in the rd operations of
large industrial corporations its basis is a body of survey data collected
from 2000 engineers and scientists in 13 establishments of four corporations
and from 1200 members of the institute of electrical and electronics
engineers the data describe instances in which respondents acquired useful
technical information from sources outside their immediate circle of
colleagues the analysis is descriptive in character following a functional
approach in which the use of various means of information transfer is
considered in relation to the purposes of technical work
while the data in general confirm the results of other studies of this
sort they demonstrate also that the relative use of alternative means will
vary significantly with the circumstances of their use the report explores
the association of variations in a number of specific personal organizational
and technological factors with variations in the use of sources of
information in a more general interpretation of these findings those
variations are related to aspects of the goals of the work to which the
information was applied
the purposes of technical work are considered along two basic dimensions
one relating to the potential for contribution to the development of some body
of systematic knowledge the other to the support of particular operational
objectives when the focus of work is on operational goals local and informal
sources account for most instances of information transfer formal and more
distant sources are the most common means used when the focus is on
professional goals ie those concerned with contributions to knowledge
in conclusion the report discusses the effects which management may have
within an organization on the process of information transfer and the need
for managers and students of the process to take into account the interplay in
this process of personal values task requisites and the structure of formal
and social groups firms need to establish twoway communication about needs
and possibilities by so doing they may enhance the effectiveness with which
advances in knowledge are translated into innovations in technology meeting the
needs of society

in 1963 research at the harvard business school was initiated
by richard rosenbloom and frank wolek to describe the process
by which technical information is communicated and used national
and corporate attention had been increasingly drawn to the
interaction between scientific and technological advance and social
change this problem was considered to be of considerable
practical importance at that time as it still is this volume
is a product of that effort the research focuses upon the flow of
technical information across organizational lines in the research and
development operations of large industrial corporations the basis of
the work is a body of survey data collected from 2000 engineers and

from november 1966 through june 1968 the library of congress conducted a
pilot project involving the weekly distribution of its traditional 3x5 catalog
cards in machinereadable form the marc records provided a search data base
for an experiment in current awareness service designed to furnish faculty with
biweekly lists of bibliographic notices of new monographs in their specified
fields of interest
of the 298 social sciences faculty members queried about their interest in
participating 209 70 percent responded affirmatively only 40 participants
could be accommodated so they were chosen in proportion to the number of
faculty members in each department or school anthropologyl business10
economics3 education15 government4 history4 and sociology3
an interest statement from each faculty member was translated into both
library of congress classification numbers eg e6ll and subject heading
terms ie elements of discrete heading separated by a comma dash
parenthesis or period eg ushistcivil warprisoners exchange of
becomes six terms ushistcivil warprisonersexchange of the resulting
interest profiles were recorded on punched cards for computer matching with
subject headings and class numbers
the weighted term search strategy was used in comparing profiles with marc
records each profile was assigned a cutoff weight or hit level of 6
subject heading terms were assigned positive or negative weights so that the
sum of weights on matching terms would be equal to exceed or be less than
the hit level thereby appropriately causing or preventing the selection of a
particular record all class numbers were assigned a weight of 6 so that a
hit would occur on any matching number
three computer programs were employed in producing the sdi lists program
extract used marc master tapes as input and extracted the card number
accession number subject heading terms and class number for current
records program retrieve compared these terms and class numbers with those in
the profiles and recorded the card numbers for hits program print compared
these card numbers with those on complete marc records and printed three copies
of each record to be sent to the faculty one copy was for the faculty
members own use one was to be evaluated and returned and one was to be used
for making recommendations to the library
subject headings proved to be more effective in searching the marc file
mainly because multiple subject headings may be assigned to each record
whereas there is only one class number and a hit often occurred on a records
second or third heading
the sdi system performed well in selecting performed well in selecting
relevant records and overall evaluations were highly favorable some 73
percent of notices received by faculty members were for works judged new to the
faculty the majority felt that the sdi service provided an automatic
regular notification of new works they felt that it usually brought works to
their attention quicker than other sources it informed them of items they
otherwise would have missed it furnished a compact source listing books in all
but only their fields it required very little time and it provided a
convenient means for making library recommendations and therefore increased the
amount of recommending done all faculty expressed a desire to have sdi
service continued

many synthesis identification and control problems that arise in
distributed parameter systems are studied two major approaches viz the
frequency domain approach and the time domain approach are considered the
techniques developed overcome many difficulties that are associated with
optimization problems in distributed parameter systems
in the frequency domain distributed systems described by the general
linear telegraphers equations are considered over a finite band of
frequencies an electric network equivalent to these systems is developed
many optimization problems that are of practical interest are formulated
in terms of this new equivalent network some of the basic principles of
lumped network theory are applied to formulate these optimization problems
many advantages in the method of solution due to this formulation are
discussed
in the time domain a method of characteristics is developed as a method of
solution for optimization problems first and second order hyperbolic systems
are considered imbedding and gradient techniques developed along the
characteristics are shown to have numerous computational advantages it is
shown that solving for greens function and associated eigenvalue problem is
not required
it is hoped that the methods developed here will lead efficiently to actual
realization of optimal distributed systems

for the last several decades library collections have been growing at
exponential rates with no relief evident in the future
to help ease the growing financial burden of housing their collections
many librarians have suggested employment compact storage depositories for
littleused materials two aspects to be considered in designing a storage
system are the fraction of the collection which is to be stored and the
criteria to be used for selecting materials for storage this study
demonstrates that for a given selection criterion leastcost storage
quantities can be assessed by balancing the large circulation costs and the
small shelving costs associated with stored materials
two storage criteria one based upon the age of the materials and the
other utilizing the individual book usage rates are discussed and compared
for the age policy the objective is the determination of a leastcost critical
age at which materials are transferred to storage and which defines the
fraction of the collection that should be stored the model assumes that the
circulation rate of the books decline with age according to an average
geometric pattern of obsolescence
the average time gap between the most recent circulations of books is
utilized as the measure for rate of usage of a book the storage decision
variable resulting from the minimization of the total cost function of the usage
rate policy is a critical intercirculation gap the maximum amount of time that
a book should be permitted to remain in a working collection without being
used those books which are stored by the above rule might be those for which
the time since last use exceeds the critical intercirculation gap hence
although the leastcost selection rule is independent of the composite
distribution of usage rates the fraction of the collection stored depends upon
the circulation activities of the individual libraries
an empirical evaluation of the storage models was made using data collected
from three libraries at purdue university and estimates of cost parameters
extracted from the literature calculations for the leastcost decision rules
and the related costs demonstrate that significant savings can be realized from
storage of materials but the calculations indicate that a large portion of the
collection must be stored
comparisons of the age policy and the usage rate policy indicate that the
latter criterion is preferred for all cases examined including a situation
where the usage rate policy is handicapped with a relatively high unit
relocation cost
sensitivity analyses of the cost parameters for practical ranges of values
show that the choice for the length of the planning horizon has a relatively
insignificant effect on the decision rules that changes in the
capacityrelated cost parameters will cause significant changes in the results
and that the rules are extremely sensitive to changes in the circulation cost
differential an important component of the latter consideration is a rather
subjective estimate for the cost of a service delay which appears to have a
potentially large influence on the decision rules

access to the literature is an essential requirement for advanced research
libraries particularly academic libraries have traditionally borne the major
responsibility for providing public access to the worlds literature most
universities have developed rather complex multilibrary systems of specialized
libraries in order to meet the needs of various groups which they serve this
use of special libraries to meet the needs of particular groups has generally
resulted in a somewhat arbitrary division of the literature by disciplines
the purpose of this study is to investigate some of the effects that this
division of the literature has on its accessibility and in particular to
examine the disciplines the interdisciplinary relationships and the
scattering characteristics as they are revealed by journal usage patterns
these results are applied to the problem of planning and design of library
systems
measures of journal productivity are proposed and means of actually
estimating these measures based on citations usage and abstract data are
developed each of these means of estimating journal productivity has its
advantages and limitations since these value measures are usually made
relative to a particular discipline many problems arise unless disciplines can
be defined in comparable terms a discipline wheel is proposed which can
serve as a conceptual framework in which to view the different disciplines
this framework provides a basis for measuring the breadth of a discipline and
also for measuring the similarity between two disciplines
one of the more important characteristics which has emerged from the study
of journal productivity is the concept of scattering of articles or title
dispersion a powerful tool for describing this phenomenon which has
resulted from earlier studies is the bradford distribution the bradford
distribution is fitted to over fifty groups of productivity data from various
sources with mixed results other possible distributions particularly the
yule borel and the fisher distributions are also considered
the applications of productivity functions in the operation design and
evaluation of library systems are virtually unlimited their use in
determining the size of a collection finding the marginal value of adding
additional journals to a collection determining user convenience and
building mathematical models of library systems are among some of the
applications which are considered it is also possible based on productivity
functions to predict the comprehensiveness of a particular library system as
a function of the number of subscriptions it receives
the purdue university libraries provided an actual library system to which
the above concepts could be applied a large set of citation data was
collected this data consisted of 24953 citations from 752 phd
dissertations written in technical fields at purdue university complete
records of the universitys scientific journal holdings were also obtained
the bradford distribution is fitted to the citation data with generally
satisfactory results the similarity between the different scientific
disciplines is measured as is the similarity
between the different libraries the breadth of the disciplines is also
measured differences between the journal usage patterns and the systems
holdings are examined alternate library system configurations are proposed
and evaluated through the use of comprehensiveness functions
this study shows that it is possible to quantitatively measure such concepts
as title dispersion breadth of a discipline the similarity between
disciplines and others the quantification of these concepts leads to a basis
for the design and evaluation of complete library systems

largescale online information storage and retrieval systems pose numerous
problems above those encountered by smaller systems the more critical of
these problems involve degree of automation flexibility browsability
storage space and retrieval time a step toward the solution of these problems
is presented here along with several demonstrations of feasibility and
advantages
the methodology on which this solution is based is that of a posteriori
automatic classification of the document collection feasibility is
demonstrated by automatically classifying a file of 50000 document
descriptions the advantages of automatic classification are demonstrated by
establishing methods for measuring the quality of classification systems and
applying these measures to a number of different classification strategies
by indexing the 50000 documents by two independent methods one manual and
one automatic it is shown that these advantages are not dependent upon the
indexing method used
it was found that among those automatic classification algorithms studied
one particular algorithm clasfy consistently outperformed the others in
addition it was found that this algorithm produced classifications at least
as good with respect to the measured established in this dissertation as
the a priori manual classification system currently in use with the
aforementioned file
the actual classification schedules produced by clasfy in classifying a
file of almost 50000 document descriptions into 265 categories are included
as an appendix to this dissertation

the increasing volume of published literature continues to present
problems in relation to information handling and information representation
as the magnitude and complexity of the available information has continued
to increase investigators have examined means of reducing the costly and
timeconsuming processes involved when human beings assign index terms to
documents recognition of the general inadequacy of present indexing and
concern over time and cost factors in index preparation have prompted
experimentation in the development and application of machines to assist
in the indexing process as a result use of suitable mechanized or partly
mechanized procedures to replace or complement the manual indexing process
has become more widespread machine indexing is a process whereby mechanized
or automatic selection or generation of indexing terms is accomplished the
present study investigates one aspect of automatic computerbased indexing

procedures for indexing and classifying these allow some delegation
from subject specialists who understand the subject matter to
library staff who can recognize the ways in which specialists talk
about it the procedures consider mostly only the interpretation
of texts not the text itself as an object with recognizable marks
subject to the laws of physics and the principles of engineering
they assume the problems of topic identification solved and the
methods for recovering physical texts as independent of the methods
for describing the interpretations of texts

a university library is both a collegiate library and a research library
it is collegiate in its provision of books and other documentary records
to support the students program of instruction and to encourage the
habit of reading and the use of libraries as does the college library
the university library must also provide materials for use by the faculty
members in the preparation of their courses of instruction and by the staff
of the institution in the performance of their administrative responsibilities
however the university library differs from the college library in offering
a wider range of undergraduate programs offering graduate instruction beyond
the masters level and usually offering advanced professional programs in a
number of fields

the development of the separately housed undergraduate library on the
modern university campus is a recent innovation  so recent in fact that
in september 1965 there were only six such libraries in the united states
the interest in effective undergraduate education which led to the creation
of these libraries however is not of such recent origin as early as 1608
when thomas james was appointed to bodleys library he proposed the
establishment of an undergraduate library to help the younger student but
sir thomas bodley was opposed so it is to harvard that we turn for an
example of the protracted concern for the undergraduates plight
despite the concern voiced by these earlier writers most universities and
their libraries were relatively small until this century more important
they were largely undergraduate institutions the great expansion of
graduate education is a twentiethcentury phenomenon the problems of the
undergraduate in using university collections were greatly compounded by
the striking growth in the size of collections and by an increasing emphasis
on the acquisition of materials suitable for research
the large university collections became increasingly difficult for the
undergraduate to use when he had to select his books from the card catalog
and obtain them through paging in a closedstack system he might well
abandon the attempt before finally locating a book which was not checked out
missing or at the bindery  and which was suitable for his purposes the
university library was also difficult to use because it was crowded  study
conditions were unsatisfactory and staff was insufficient to handle the
volume of work

when it was decided that cognitive psychology would not specify
size limits for articles and that we would publish relevant papers in
artificial intelligence we hardly anticipated devoting an entire issue to a
single piece of work however winograds program for understanding
natural language seems sufficiently general and important in its
implications to warrant the experiment some readers will find sufficient
the first two sections which present respectively an overview of the
system and what it does and a firstrate evaluation of research in artificial
intelligence on natural language processing semantics and theorem proving
others will want to explore in detail the structure of the syntactic
component the treatment of semantics and the programming language

the output of scientific literature has been increasing exponentially since
the second quarter of this century new journals in specialized branches of
science keep appearing and established periodicals either multiply the number of
volumes per year or split into different titles covering narrower subject
areas in order to cope with the flow of communications received for
publication the limited resources or libraries particularly in the
developing countries do not permit them to increase library space or budget at
a rate commensurate with this rise in publication consequently research
libraries in such countries as india must be highly selective in their
acquisition programmes and to do so without detriment to the research interests
of the institution they serve they urgently need dependable data on the ranking
of periodicals according to the particular research needs of their respective
countries in this article an attempt is made to rank periodicals in the field
of the biomedical sciences from the point of view of the indian scientist
this method may also be followed in the libraries of other developing countries
by changing the citing journals according to their countrys needs

the essentially logistical problem of making library books physically
available when wanted by library users is central to librarianship this
book is a tentative attempt to provide a treatise on this problem as such
it has to deal with both theoretical analysis and the practicality of
solutions no apology is made for the attention devoted to theoretical
analysis because the author believes that a clear conceptual understanding
of the factors involved is important for improved librarianship the
fact that analytical models are not always usable does not mean that the
insight that can sometimes be derived from such analyses will not lead to
a better understanding of the problems and thereby to improved library
services

published it is tempting to say that it is a half a century overdue when
librarians first began to look beyond their national borders bibliographic
control was in the forefront of their concern gradually however these
pioneers of international librarianship began to realize that technical
problems were too ambitious for multilateral action and in their discussions
the emphasis was placed more on functions and organizations on the social
and even economic achievements of the international library community 
which was not fully international at all  were limited to comparisons of
national efforts with some countries constantly overcritical and others
overgenerous outstanding bibliographic projects like the gesamtkatalog der
wiegendrucke were international in scope but national in conception

we feel that a profound change has occurred in linguistic thinking
in the last decade it is not longer of any interest to describe
one after another language anyhow without regard to the relevance
of the facts to general linguistic theory as ross put it it makes
no sense to talk about describing a language in terms of its own
structure alone toward the end of the conference when it had become
apparent that the general agreement did not encompass any currently
explicitly formulated model the question was raised what should we
be teaching our students langendoens answer seems to us most apt
we should give them the ability to recognize a interesting linguistic
problem when they see one that is one which throws some light 
negative or positive  on our conceptions of what languages in general
are like

the work reported here is a study of the utilization of the card
catalog of a very large library specifically the principal catalog of
the library system of yale university
the study was motivated by two basic concerns one of them of a
longterm or exploratory nature the other of a shortterm or
operationally supportive nature the longterm concern is the question
of how to design a computerized catalog for a very large library that
can be expected to give the best possible performance the shortterm
concern is the question of whether and of so how existing card
catalogs in very large libraries may be made more responsive to user
requirements it was recognized that a carefully designed study of actual
utilization of a catalog of a large library could shed useful light in
both areas of concern

this book is based upon two recent research projects in weeding and
identifying core collections however it became apparent that the principles
and techniques studied are applicable to almost all types of library
collections
this work has been designed to be used for four distinct purposes
1 as a comprehensive source summarizing the opinion knowledge and
serious research in the field of weeding the authors own research is
reported in such detail that replication of the studies is possible in
addition this book contains the first report of the harrison study
2 as a doityourself guide for librarians wishing to weed out their
present collections it is the aim of this book not only to explain and
justify its methods but to include a stepbystep procedure for weeding
without tears
3 as a textbook in library schools especially in courses that deal with
the acquisition and maintenance of library collections for weeding is one
of the best techniques available for the longrange building of useful
collections
4 as a stimulus to further study in this entire area it is hoped that
libraries using the recommended methods will measure and report upon the costs
of weeding and the impact of such weeding upon changes in the amount of
circulation and in user satisfaction

is that approximately 80 percent of the number of
transactions taken from a warehouse represents about
20 percent of the items stocked this may also be
considered as a ranking of stock items by their
transaction activity which will show that the top 20
percent of the stocked items ie the most active
items account for about 80 percent of the total
number of transactions the rule is sometimes
expressed as the 7525 rule with the same interpretation

is a precise and concise means of expressing the structural
formulas of chemical compounds its basic idea is to use
letter symbols to denote functional groups and to use numbers
to express the lengths of alkyl chains and the sizes of rings
these symbols then are cited in connecting order from one end of
the molecule to the other for the past hundred years ever
since structural chemistry began chemists have been using graphic
symbols in this way this lineformula notation is simply an
extension and standardization of this practice

the basic plan for this book was evolved during the summer of 1959
at that time i was working on a chapter entitled industrial social
psychology for the annual review of psychology i was impressed by
the large amount of research being conducted in the field but found
the task of integrating that research and of identifying the progress
made during the period of the review exceedingly difficult in part
this difficulty was a result of the great differences among investigators
in the phenomena they selected for study and the methods they used
to study it a more troublesome problem however was the apparent
theoretical implications of their research concepts tended to be
highly specific and inadequately defined there was little standardization
of terminology and little consideration for the nature of the processes

population growth and the world environment has expanded rapidly
as worldwide stresses have increased many individuals and
organizations have begun to study and to influence the changing
aspects of the world situation but it seems fair to observe
that most of the activity has been addressed to separate facets
of the world system little has yet been done to show how the many
actions and forces are affecting one another to produce the total
consequences that we observe now however many persons are coming
to believe that the interactions within the whole are more important

philosophies and new attitudes in the library profession the
intention of the present work is to examine some of the
implications of this rapid growth in the number of library
schools noting current trends and possible changes in the
future inevitably some limitations have had to be imposed
and there has been a deliberate concentration upon anglo
american library education while at the same time examining
other major patterns of professional education for librarians
which exist in the world and comparing these with the
approach of the english speaking countries an attempt has
been made to trace the influences which the british and
